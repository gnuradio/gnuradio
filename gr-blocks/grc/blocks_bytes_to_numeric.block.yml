documentation: This block converts a raw byte stream to a numeric type (such as a complex, float, etc). The input byte stream must be ordered as if the block was directly written to memory, with this block acting as a C-style cast from uint8_t to the output type. No scaling or modification is performed on the stream before casting. System-native endianness is used, mostly this will be little-endian.
