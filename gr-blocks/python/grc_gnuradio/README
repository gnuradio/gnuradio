This is the grc_gnuradio module.
It contains supplemental python modules that grc uses at runtime.
The supplemental modules are meant to mimic modules in gnuradio.
These will be phased-out as new functionaility is merged into gnuradio.

The blk2s module wraps many blocks in blks2 and gives them streaming outputs.
Will be phased-out by new message passing implementations.
Other blks2 blocks will hopefully make their way into blks2impl.

The wxgui module contains a top_block + wxgui frame.
Will be phased-out by gui.py in wxgui and a new top block template.
