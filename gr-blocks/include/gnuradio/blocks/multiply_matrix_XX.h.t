     * \brief Matrix multiplexer/multiplier: y(k) = A * x(k)
     * \ingroup blocks
     *
     * This block is similar to gr::blocks::multiply_const_ff, the difference
     * being it can handle several inputs and outputs, and the input-to-output
     * relation can be described by the following mathematical equation:
     * \f[
     *    \mathbf{y}(k) = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}(k) \, , \, y \in \mathbb{R}^N, \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^M, A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}
     * \f]
     * \f$\mathbf{y}(k)\f$ and \f$\mathbf{x}(i)\f$ are column-vectors describing the elements on the input port
     * at time step \f$k\f$ (this is a sync block with no memory).
     *
     * Examples for where to use this block include:
     * - Switch matrices (i.e. switch which ports go where), assuming all ports run on the same rate
     * - Simulation of static MIMO-Channels (in that case, \f$\mathbf{A}\f$ is the channel matrix)
     * - Summing up streams with variable coefficients
     *
     * This block features a special tag propagation mode: When setting the tag propagation policy
     * to gr::blocks::@NAME@::TPP_SELECT_BY_MATRIX, a tag is propagated from input k
     * to output l if \f$(A)_{l,k} \neq 0\f$.
     *
     * \section blocks_matrixmult_msgports_@NAME@ Message Ports
     *
     * This block as one input message port (\p set_A). A message sent to this port will
     * be converted to a std::vector<std::vector<@O_TYPE@> >, and then passed on to set_A().
     * If no conversion is possible, a warning is issued via the logging interface, and
     * A remains unchanged.
     *
     * *Note*: It is not possible to change the dimension of the matrix after initialization,
     * as this affects the I/O signature! If a matrix of invalid size is passed to the block,
     * an alert is raised via the logging interface, and A remains unchanged.
