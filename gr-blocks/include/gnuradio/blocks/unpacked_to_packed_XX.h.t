     * \brief Convert a stream of unpacked bytes or shorts into a stream of packed bytes or shorts.

     * \details
     * input: stream of @I_TYPE@; output: stream of @O_TYPE@
     *
     * This is the inverse of gr::blocks::packed_to_unpacked_XX.
     *
     * The low \p bits_per_chunk bits are extracted from each input
     * byte or short.  These bits are then packed densely into the
     * output bytes or shorts, such that all 8 or 16 bits of the
     * output bytes or shorts are filled with valid input bits.  The
     * right thing is done if bits_per_chunk is not a power of two.
     *
     * The combination of gr::blocks::packed_to_unpacked_XX followed by
     * gr_chunks_to_symbols_Xf or gr_chunks_to_symbols_Xc handles the
     * general case of mapping from a stream of bytes or shorts into
     * arbitrary float or complex symbols.
