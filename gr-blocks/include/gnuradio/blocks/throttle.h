 * N.B. this should only be used in GUI apps where there is no
 * other rate limiting block. It is not intended nor effective at
 * precisely controlling the rate of samples. That should be
 * controlled by a source or sink tied to sample clock. E.g., a
 * USRP or audio card.
 *
 * You can insert this block "in series" with your sample flow, in which case it  does a
 * throttled copy of input to output. Alternatively, you can not connect its output and
 * just connect this block's input in parallel to an existing block in your flow graph. In
 * that case, Throttle will limit the rate at which samples are consumed; especially at
 * higher rates, where the copying overhead might be significant, this is functionally not
 * different to copying at a limited rate.
