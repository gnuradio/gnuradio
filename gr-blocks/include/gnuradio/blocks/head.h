 * Useful for building test cases, this block consumes only N items from its input, and
 * copies them to its output, if that is connected.
 *
 * You can hence use this block in series with your sample flow if you want a block
 * downstream of it to be tested with an exact number of input items; or you can put it in
 * parallel to your data path, so that it stops at most one buffer size after the
 * specified number of items has been produced upstream.
