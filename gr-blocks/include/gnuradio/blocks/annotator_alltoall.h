     * \details
     * This block creates tags to be sent downstream every 10,000
     * items it sees. The tags contain the name and ID of the
     * instantiated block, use "seq" as a key, and have a counter that
     * increments by 1 for every tag produced that is used as the
     * tag's value. The tags are propagated using the all-to-all
     * policy.
     *
     * It also stores a copy of all tags it sees flow past it. These
     * tags can be recalled externally with the data() member.
     *
     * This block is only meant for testing and showing how to use the tags.
