     * \brief Repack \p k bits from the input stream onto \p l bits of the output stream.
     * \ingroup byte_operators_blk
     *
     * \details
     * No bits are lost here; any value for k and l (within [1, 8]) is allowed.
     * On every fresh input byte, it starts reading on the LSB, and starts copying
     * to the LSB as well.
     *
     * When supplying a tag name, this block operates on tagged streams.
     * In this case, it can happen that the input data or the output data
     * becomes unaligned when k * input length is not equal to l * output length.
     * In this case, the \p align_output parameter is used to decide which
     * data packet to align.
     *
     * Usually, \p align_output is false for unpacking (k=8, l < 8) and false for
     * reversing that.
     *
     * \section gr_blocks_repack_example Example
     *
     * Say you're tx'ing 8-PSK and therefore set k=8, l=3 on the transmit side
     * before the modulator. Now assume you're transmitting a single byte of data.
     * Your incoming tagged stream has length 1, the outgoing has length 3. However,
     * the third item is actually only carrying 2 bits of relevant data, the bits
     * do not align with the boundaries. So you set \p align_output = false,
     * because the output can be unaligned.
     *
     * Now say you're doing the inverse: packing those three items into full
     * bytes. How do you interpret those three bytes? Without this flag,
     * you'd have to assume there's 9 relevant bits in there, so you'd end up
     * with 2 bytes of output data. But in the packing case, you want the
     * \b output to be aligned; all output bits must be useful. By asserting this flag,
     * the packing algorithm tries to do this and in this case assumes that
     * since we have alignment after 8 bits, the 9th can be discarded.
