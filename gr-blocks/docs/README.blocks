This is the gr-blocks package. It contains the basic blocks that are
widely used in many different types of flowgraphs. To use these blocks,
the Python namespace is in gnuradio.blocks, which would be normally
imported as:

    from gnuradio import blocks

See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:

    help(blocks)
