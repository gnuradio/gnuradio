 * \brief The abstract base class for all 'terminal' processing blocks.
 * \ingroup base_blk
 *
 * A signal processing flow is constructed by creating a tree of
 * hierarchical blocks, which at any level may also contain terminal
 * nodes that actually implement signal processing functions. This
 * is the base class for all such leaf nodes.
 *
 * Blocks have a set of input streams and output streams.  The
 * input_signature and output_signature define the number of input
 * streams and output streams respectively, and the type of the data
 * items in each stream.
 *
 * Blocks report the number of items consumed on each input in
 * general_work(), using consume() or consume_each().
 *
 * If the same number of items is produced on each output, the block
 * returns that number from general_work(). Otherwise, the block
 * calls produce() for each output, then returns
 * WORK_CALLED_PRODUCE. The input and output rates are not required
 * to be related.
 *
 * User derived blocks override two methods, forecast and
 * general_work, to implement their signal processing
 * behavior. forecast is called by the system scheduler to determine
 * how many items are required on each input stream in order to
 * produce a given number of output items.
 *
 * general_work is called to perform the signal processing in the
 * block.  It reads the input items and writes the output items.
