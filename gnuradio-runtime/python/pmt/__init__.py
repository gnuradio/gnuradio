Polymorphic Types.

The type can really be used to store anything, but also has simple
conversion methods for common data types such as bool, long, or a
vector.

The polymorphic type simplifies message passing between blocks, as all
of the data is of the same type, including the message. Tags also use
PMTs as data type, so a stream tag can be of any logical data type. In
a sense, PMTs are a way to extend C++' strict typing with something
more flexible.

The PMT library supports the following major types:
bool, symbol (string), integer, real, complex, null, pair, list,
vector, dict, uniform_vector, any (boost::any cast)
