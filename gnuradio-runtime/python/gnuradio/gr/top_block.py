    This kludge allows ^C to interrupt top_block.run and top_block.wait

    The problem that we are working around is that Python only services
    signals (e.g., KeyboardInterrupt) in its main thread.  If the main
    thread is blocked in our C++ version of wait, even though Python's
    SIGINT handler fires, and even though there may be other python
    threads running, no one will know.  Thus instead of directly waiting
    in the thread that calls wait (which is likely to be the Python main
    thread), we create a separate thread that does the blocking wait,
    and then use the thread that called wait to do a slow poll of an
    event queue.  That thread, which is executing "wait" below is
    interruptible, and if it sees a KeyboardInterrupt, executes a stop
    on the top_block, then goes back to waiting for it to complete.
    This ensures that the unlocked wait that was in progress (in the
    _top_block_waiter thread) can complete, release its mutex and back
    out.  If we don't do that, we are never able to clean up, and nasty
    things occur like leaving the USRP transmitter sending a carrier.

    See also top_block.wait (below), which uses this class to implement
    the interruptible wait.
