For info on ControlPort and Thrift, see the wiki page:

This readme is to address the patch file in the repo for Thrift. We
believe that there is a bug in Thrift itself that occasionally causes
a segfault when shutting down the server. If you run into a problem
when shutting down an application running ControlPort, this might be
the cause. If so, we have included a patch with the source code in
this directory that should be applied to Thrift before rebuilding the
Thrift library:

thrift-codebase-shutdown-patch.diff

Note that we are working off Thrift version 0.9.2, so this patch may
not be relevant or even cleanly apply in later versions of Thrift.

We are also still trying to track down another shutdown problem with
Thrift that again appears to be related to their code. If a segfault
persists after the above patch is applied to Thrift, do a backtrace in
GDB to see what the error looks like. If it is different than the
following backtrace, definitely report it to the Discuss GNU Radio
Mailing List as a known bug. If you see the same backtrace as here,
this is a known bug that occurs very irregularly, but help in tracing
down the cause is appreciated.
