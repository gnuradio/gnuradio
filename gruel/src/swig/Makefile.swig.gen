# Makefile.swig.gen for pmt_swig.i

## Default install locations for these files:
##
## Default location for the Python directory is:
##  ${prefix}/lib/python${python_version}/site-packages/[category]/pmt_swig
## Default location for the Python exec directory is:
##  ${exec_prefix}/lib/python${python_version}/site-packages/[category]/pmt_swig
##
## The following can be overloaded to change the install location, but
## this has to be done in the including Makefile.am -before-
## Makefile.swig is included.

pmt_swig_pylibdir_category ?= $(pmt_swig_pythondir_category)

## This is a template file for a "generated" Makefile addition (in
## this case, "Makefile.swig.gen").  By including the top-level
## Makefile.swig, this file will be used to generate the SWIG
## dependencies.  Assign the variable TOP_SWIG_FILES to be the list of
## SWIG .i files to generated wrappings for; there can be more than 1
## so long as the names are unique (no sorting is done on the
## TOP_SWIG_FILES list). This file explicitly assumes that a SWIG .i
## file will generate .cc, .py, and possibly .h files -- meaning that
## all of these files will have the same base name (that provided for
## the SWIG .i file).
##
## This code is setup to ensure parallel MAKE ("-j" or "-jN") does the
## right thing.  For more info, see <
## http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Multiple-Outputs >

## Other cleaned files: dependency files generated by SWIG or this Makefile

MOSTLYCLEANFILES += $(DEPDIR)/*.S*

## Various SWIG variables.  These can be overloaded in the including
## Makefile.am by setting the variable value there, then including
## Makefile.swig .
