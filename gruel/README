The GNU Radio Utility Etcetera Library, a collection of low-level routines
to avoid dependencies on the full GNU Radio core or other libraries.

Over time, some code from libgnuradio-core and libpmt will migrate
here, to avoid duplication of code and simplify dependencies.

By design, this library will not have dependencies on any other part
of GNU Radio, but may have external dependencies such as Boost.
