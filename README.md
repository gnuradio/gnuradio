GNU Radio is a free & open-source signal processing runtime and signal processing
software development toolkit. Originally developed for use with software-defined
radios and for simulating wireless communications, it's robust capabilities have
led to adoption in hobbyist, academic, and commercial environments. GNU Radio has
found use in software-defined radio, digital communications, nuclear physics, high-
energy particle physics, astrophysics, radio astronomy and more!

## Legal Matters

Some files have been changed many times throughout the years. Copyright 
notices at the top of source files list which years changes have been 
made. For some files, changes have occurred in many consecutive years. 
These files may often have the format of a year range (e.g., "2006 - 2011"), 
which indicates that these files have had copyrightable changes made 
during each year in the range, inclusive.
