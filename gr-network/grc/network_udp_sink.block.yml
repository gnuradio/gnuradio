documentation: "This block provides basic UDP data transmission capabilities with\
    \ a few additional features for processing in custom receiving applications. \
    \ \nA header can be added in various formats for tracking.  For instance all headers\
    \ also provide a sequence number that can be used to identify gaps in packets.\
    \  \nNote that payload size impacts the overall size of a single UDP packet. \
    \ For a normal network, a payload size of 1472 (1500-28 for UDP headers) represents\
    \ the max size for a standard UDP packet. For jumbo frames, 8972 can be used\
    \ (9000-28).  Be careful adjusting this parameter as you could inadvertently cause\
    \ unnecessary packet fragmentation and reconstruction.\n\n\
    \ NOTES:\n\
    \ This block does support connecting to IPv6 addresses.  If an IPv6 address\
    \ is detected as the destination IP address, the block will automatically\
    \ adjust for proper connection.  Just make sure your IPv6 stack is enabled.\n\n\
    \ For best performance and to ensure UDP packets are not dropped, add the following\
    \ lines to your /etc/sysctl.conf and reboot (the reboot is required).\n\n\
    \ net.core.rmem_default=26214400\n\
    \ net.core.rmem_max=104857600\n\
    \ net.core.wmem_default=65536\n\
    \ net.core.wmem_max=104857600\n\n\
    \ IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that the example test_udp_source/sink flowgraphs be\
    \ tested with the sequence number header enabled (the default in those flowgraphs)\
    \ as a validation that no network or IP stack bottlenecks may cause dropped packets\
    \ at the rates planned in your environment before using in production, especially if\
    \ headers will not be used in your environment to track dropped packets."
