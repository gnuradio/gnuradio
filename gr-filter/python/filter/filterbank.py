        The channel spacing is equal to the input sample rate.
        The total bandwidth and output sample rate are equal the input
        sample rate * nchannels.

        Output stream to frequency mapping:

          channel zero is at zero frequency.

          if mpoints is odd:

            Channels with increasing positive frequencies come from
            channels 1 through (N-1)/2.

            Channel (N+1)/2 is the maximum negative frequency, and
            frequency increases through N-1 which is one channel lower
            than the zero frequency.

          if mpoints is even:

            Channels with increasing positive frequencies come from
            channels 1 through (N/2)-1.

            Channel (N/2) is evenly split between the max positive and
            negative bins.

            Channel (N/2)+1 is the maximum negative frequency, and
            frequency increases through N-1 which is one channel lower
            than the zero frequency.

            Channels near the frequency extremes end up getting cut
            off by subsequent filters and therefore have diminished
            utility.
