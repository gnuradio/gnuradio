    (n, fo, ao, w) = remezord (f, a, dev) finds the approximate order,
    normalized frequency band edges, frequency band amplitudes, and
    weights that meet input specifications f, a, and dev, to use with
    the remez command.

    * f is a sequence of frequency band edges (between 0 and Fs/2, where
      Fs is the sampling frequency), and a is a sequence specifying the
      desired amplitude on the bands defined by f. The length of f is
      twice the length of a, minus 2. The desired function is
      piecewise constant.

    * dev is a sequence the same size as a that specifies the maximum
      allowable deviation or ripples between the frequency response
      and the desired amplitude of the output filter, for each band.

    Use remez with the resulting order n, frequency sequence fo,
    amplitude response sequence ao, and weights w to design the filter b
    which approximately meets the specifications given by remezord
    input parameters f, a, and dev:

    b = remez (n, fo, ao, w)

    (n, fo, ao, w) = remezord (f, a, dev, Fs) specifies a sampling frequency Fs.

    Fs defaults to 2 Hz, implying a Nyquist frequency of 1 Hz. You can
    therefore specify band edges scaled to a particular applications
    sampling frequency.

    In some cases remezord underestimates the order n. If the filter
    does not meet the specifications, try a higher order such as n+1
    or n+2.
