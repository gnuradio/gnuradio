This is the gr-filter package. It contains signal processing blocks to
perform filtering operations.

The Python namespace is in gnuradio.filter, which would be normally
imported as:

See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:
