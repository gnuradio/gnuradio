     *
     * \details
     *
     * The PFB sythesis filterbank combines multiple baseband signals
     * into a single channelized signal. Each input stream is,
     * essentially, modulated onto an output channel according the the
     * channel mapping (see set_channel_map for details).
     *
     * Setting this filterbank up means selecting the number of output
     * channels, the prototype filter, and whether to handle channels
     * at 2x the sample rate (this is generally used only for
     * reconstruction filtering).
     *
     * The number of channels sets the maximum number of channels to
     * use, but not all input streams must be connected. For M total
     * channels, we can connect inputs 0 to N where N < M-1. Because
     * of the way GNU Radio handles stream connections, we must
     * connect the channels consecutively, and so we must use the
     * set_channel_map if the desired output channels are not the same
     * as the the default mapping. This features gives us the
     * flexibility to output to any given channel. Generally, we try
     * to not use the channels at the edge of the spectrum to avoid
     * issues with filtering and roll-off of the transmitter or
     * receiver.
     *
     * When using the 2x sample rate mode, we specify the number of
     * channels that will be used. However, the actual output signal
     * will be twice this number of channels. This is mainly important
     * to know when setting the channel map. For M channels, the
     * channel mapping can specy from 0 to 2M-1 channels to output
     * onto.
     *
     * For more details about this and the concepts of reconstruction
     * filtering, see:
