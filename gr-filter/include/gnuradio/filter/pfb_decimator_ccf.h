 * \brief Polyphase filterbank bandpass decimator with gr_complex
 *        input, gr_complex output and float taps
 * \ingroup channelizers_blk
 *
 * \details
 * This block takes in a signal stream and performs integer down-
 * sampling (decimation) with a polyphase filterbank. The first
 * input is the integer specifying how much to decimate by. The
 * second input is a vector (Python list) of floating-point taps
 * of the prototype filter. The third input specifies the channel
 * to extract.  By default, the zeroth channel is used, which is
 * the baseband channel (first Nyquist zone).
 *
 * The <EM>channel</EM> parameter specifies which channel to use
 * since this class is capable of bandpass decimation. Given a
 * complex input stream at a sampling rate of <EM>fs</EM> and a
 * decimation rate of <EM>decim</EM>, the input frequency domain
 * is split into <EM>decim</EM> channels that represent the
 * Nyquist zones. Using the polyphase filterbank, we can select
 * any one of these channels to decimate.
 *
 * The output signal will be the basebanded and decimated signal
 * from that channel. This concept is very similar to the PFB
 * channelizer (see #gr::filter::pfb_channelizer_ccf) where only a single
 * channel is extracted at a time.
 *
 * The filter's taps should be based on the sampling rate before
 * decimation.
 *
 * For example, using the GNU Radio's firdes utility to building
 * filters, we build a low-pass filter with a sampling rate of
 * <EM>fs</EM>, a 3-dB bandwidth of <EM>BW</EM> and a transition
 * bandwidth of <EM>TB</EM>. We can also specify the out-of-band
 * attenuation to use, <EM>ATT</EM>, and the filter window
 * function (a Blackman-harris window in this case). The first
 * input is the gain of the filter, which we specify here as
 * unity.
 *
 *   <B><EM>self._taps = filter.firdes.low_pass_2(1, fs, BW, TB,
 *      attenuation_dB=ATT, window=fft.window.WIN_BLACKMAN_hARRIS)</EM></B>
 *
 * The PFB decimator code takes the taps generated above and
 * builds a set of filters. The set contains <EM>decim</EM>
 * filters and each filter contains ceil(taps.size()/decim)
 * taps.  Each tap from the filter prototype is
 * sequentially inserted into the next filter. When all of the
 * input taps are used, the remaining filters in the filterbank
 * are filled out with 0's to make sure each filter has the same
 * number of taps.
 *
 * The theory behind this block can be found in Chapter 6 of
 * the following book:
 *
 *   <B><EM>f. harris, "Multirate Signal Processing for Communication
 *      Systems," Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, Inc. 2004.</EM></B>
