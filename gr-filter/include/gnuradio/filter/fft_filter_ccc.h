     *
     * \details
     * This block implements a complex decimating filter using the
     * fast convolution method via an FFT. The decimation factor is an
     * interger that is greater than or equal to 1.
     *
     * The filter takes a set of complex (or real) taps to use in the
     * filtering operation. These taps can be defined as anything that
     * satisfies the user's filtering needs. For standard filters such
     * as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, etc., the filter.firdes and
     * filter.optfir classes provide convenient generating methods.
     *
     * This filter is implemented by using the FFTW package to perform
     * the required FFTs. An optional argument, nthreads, may be
     * passed to the constructor (or set using the set_nthreads member
     * function) to split the FFT among N number of threads. This can
     * improve performance on very large FFTs (that is, if the number
     * of taps used is very large) if you have enough threads/cores to
     * support it.
