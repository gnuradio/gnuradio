     * This implements a Mininum Mean Squared Error interpolator with
     * 8 taps. It is suitable for signals where the bandwidth of
     * interest B = 1/(4*Ts) Where Ts is the time between samples.

     * is actually quantized. 0.0 <= mu <= 1.0. That is, mu is
     * quantized in the interpolate method to 32nd's of a sample.
     *
