     * \brief IIR filter with complex input, complex output, and
     * complex taps.
     * \ingroup filter_blk
     *
     * \details
     * This filter uses the Direct Form I implementation, where \p
     * fftaps contains the feed-forward taps, and \p fbtaps the
     * feedback ones.
     *
     * \p oldstyle: The old style of the IIR filter uses feedback
     * taps that are negative of what most definitions use (scipy
     * and Matlab among them). This parameter keeps using the old
     * GNU Radio style and is set to TRUE by default. When taps
     * generated from scipy, Matlab, or gr_filter_design, use the
     * new style by setting this to FALSE.
     *
     * The input and output satisfy a difference equation of the form
     \f[
       y[n] - \sum_{k=1}^{M} a_k y[n-k] = \sum_{k=0}^{N} b_k x[n-k]
     \f]

     \xmlonly
     y[n] - \sum_{k=1}^{M} a_k y[n-k] = \sum_{k=0}^{N} b_k x[n-k]
     \endxmlonly

     * with the corresponding rational system function
     \f[
     H(z) = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{M} b_k z^{-k}}{1 - \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k}}
     \f]

     \xmlonly
     H(z) = \ frac{\sum_{k=0}^{M} b_k z^{-k}}{1 - \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k}}
