 * \brief Polyphase filterbank arbitrary resampler with
 *        gr_complex input, gr_complex output and float taps
 * \ingroup resamplers_blk
 *
 * \details
 * This  takes in a signal stream and performs arbitrary
 * resampling. The resampling rate can be any real number
 * <EM>r</EM>. The resampling is done by constructing <EM>N</EM>
 * filters where <EM>N</EM> is the interpolation rate.  We then
 * calculate <EM>D</EM> where <EM>D = floor(N/r)</EM>.
 *
 * Using <EM>N</EM> and <EM>D</EM>, we can perform rational
 * resampling where <EM>N/D</EM> is a rational number close to
 * the input rate <EM>r</EM> where we have <EM>N</EM> filters
 * and we cycle through them as a polyphase filterbank with a
 * stride of <EM>D</EM> so that <EM>i+1 = (i + D) % N</EM>.
 *
 * To get the arbitrary rate, we want to interpolate between two
 * points. For each value out, we take an output from the
 * current filter, <EM>i</EM>, and the next filter <EM>i+1</EM>
 * and then linearly interpolate between the two based on the
 * real resampling rate we want.
 *
 * The linear interpolation only provides us with an
 * approximation to the real sampling rate specified. The error
 * is a quantization error between the two filters we used as
 * our interpolation points.  To this end, the number of
 * filters, <EM>N</EM>, used determines the quantization error;
 * the larger <EM>N</EM>, the smaller the noise. You can design
 * for a specified noise floor by setting the filter size
 * (parameters <EM>filter_size</EM>). The size defaults to 32
 * filters, which is about as good as most implementations need.
 *
 * The trick with designing this filter is in how to specify the
 * taps of the prototype filter. Like the PFB interpolator, the
 * taps are specified using the interpolated filter rate. In
 * this case, that rate is the input sample rate multiplied by
 * the number of filters in the filterbank, which is also the
 * interpolation rate. All other values should be relative to
 * this rate.
 *
 * For example, for a 32-filter arbitrary resampler and using
 * the GNU Radio's firdes utility to build the filter, we build
 * a low-pass filter with a sampling rate of <EM>fs</EM>, a 3-dB
 * bandwidth of <EM>BW</EM> and a transition bandwidth of
 * <EM>TB</EM>. We can also specify the out-of-band attenuation
 * to use, <EM>ATT</EM>, and the filter window function (a
 * Blackman-harris window in this case). The first input is the
 * gain of the filter, which we specify here as the
 * interpolation rate (<EM>32</EM>).
 *
 *   <B><EM>self._taps = filter.firdes.low_pass_2(32, 32*fs, BW, TB,
 *      attenuation_dB=ATT, window=fft.window.WIN_BLACKMAN_hARRIS)</EM></B>
 *
 * The theory behind this block can be found in Chapter 7.5 of
 * the following book:

 *   <B><EM>f. harris, "Multirate Signal Processing for Communication
 *      Systems", Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, Inc. 2004.</EM></B>
