 * \brief Filter-Delay Combination Block
 * \ingroup filter_blk
 *
 * \details
 * The purpose of this block is to compensate the delay that a linear-phase filter
 * introduces.
 *
 * It does that by introducing a delay of half the length of the FIR tap vector on
 * passed-through samples.
 *
 * The block takes one or two float stream and outputs a stream composed of pairs of
 * floats. (In GNU Radio, pairs of floats are identical to complex numbers, where the real
 * and imaginary parts are the first and second element, respectively.)
 *
 * If only one float stream is input, the first element of each output item is a delayed
 * version of this input and the second element is the filtered output.
 *
 * If two floats are connected to the input, then the first element of each output item is
 * the delayed version of the first input, and the second element is the filtered second
 * input.
 *
 * The delay in the first elements of the output accounts for the group delay introduced
 * by the filter in the second elements path under the assumption of linear-phase
 * filtering. The filter taps need to be calculated before initializing this block.
