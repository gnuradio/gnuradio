 * \brief Rational Resampling Polyphase FIR filter with IN_T
 * input, OUT_T output and TAP_T taps.
 * \ingroup resamplers_blk
 *
 * Make a rational resampling FIR filter. If the input signal is
 * at rate fs, then the output signal will be at a rate of \p
 * interpolation * fs / \p decimation.
 *
 * The interpolation and decimation rates should be kept as
 * small as possible, and generally should be relatively prime
 * to help reduce complexity in memory and computation.
 *
 * The set of \p taps supplied to this filterbank should be
 * designed around the resampling amount and must avoid aliasing
 * (when interpolation/decimation < 1) and images (when
 * interpolation/decimation > 1).
 *
 * As with any filter, the behavior of the filter taps (or
 * coefficients) is determined by the highest sampling rate that
 * the filter will ever see. In the case of a resampler that
 * increases the sampling rate, the highest sampling rate observed
 * is \p interpolation since in the filterbank, the number of
 * filter arms is equal to \p interpolation. When the resampler
 * decreases the sampling rate (decimation > interpolation), then
 * the highest rate is the input sample rate of the original
 * signal. We must create a filter based around this value to
 * reduce any aliasing that may occur from out-of-band signals.
 *
 * Another way to think about how to create the filter taps is
 * that the filter is effectively applied after interpolation and
 * before decimation. And yet another way to think of it is that
 * the taps should be a LPF that is at least as narrow as the
 * narrower of the required anti-image postfilter or anti-alias
 * prefilter.
