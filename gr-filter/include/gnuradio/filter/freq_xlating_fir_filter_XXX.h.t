     * This class efficiently combines a frequency translation
     * (typically "down conversion") with a FIR filter (typically
     * low-pass) and decimation.  It is ideally suited for a "channel
     * selection filter" and can be efficiently used to select and
     * decimate a narrow band signal out of wide bandwidth input.
     *
     * Uses a single input array to produce a single output array.
     * Additional inputs and/or outputs are ignored.
     *
     * - freq (input):
     *        Receives a PMT pair: (intern("freq"), double(frequency).
     *        The block then sets its frequency translation value to
     *        the new frequency provided by the message. A tag is then
     *        produced when the new frequency is applied to let
     *        downstream blocks know when this has taken affect.
     *        Use the filter's group delay to determine when the
     *        transients after the change have settled down.
