 * \brief Fast FFT filter with float input, float output and float taps

 *
 * \details
 * This block performs fast convolution using the
 * overlap-and-save algorithm. The filtering is performand in
 * the frequency domain instead of the time domain (see
 * gr::filter::kernel::fir_filter_fff). For an input signal x
 * and filter coefficients (taps) t, we compute y as:
 *
 * \code
 *    y = ifft(fft(x)*fft(t))
 * \endcode
 *
 * This kernel computes the FFT of the taps when they are set to
 * only perform this operation once. The FFT of the input signal
 * x is done every time.
 *
 * Because this is designed as a very low-level kernel
 * operation, it is designed for speed and avoids certain checks
 * in the filter() function itself. The filter function expects
 * that the input signal is a multiple of d_nsamples in the
 * class that's computed internally to be as fast as
 * possible. The function set_taps will return the value of
 * nsamples that can be used externally to check this
 * boundary. Notice that all implementations of the fft_filter
 * GNU Radio blocks (e.g., gr::filter::fft_filter_fff) use this
 * value of nsamples to compute the value to call
 * gr::block::set_output_multiple that ensures the scheduler
 * always passes this block the right number of samples.
