     * \details
     * This block implements a computationally efficient DC blocker that produces
     * a tighter notch filter around DC for a smaller group delay than an
     * equivalent FIR filter or using a single pole IIR filter (though the IIR
     * filter is computationally cheaper).
     *
     * The block defaults to using a delay line of length 32 and the long form
     * of the filter. Optionally, the delay line length can be changed to alter
     * the width of the DC notch (longer lines will decrease the width).
     *
     * The long form of the filter produces a nearly flat response outside of
     * the notch but at the cost of a group delay of 2D-2.
     *
     * The short form of the filter does not have as flat a response in the
     * passband but has a group delay of only D-1 and is cheaper to compute.
     *
     * The theory behind this block can be found in the paper:
     *
     *    <B><EM>R. Yates, "DC Blocker Algorithms," IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,
     *        Mar. 2008, pp 132-134.</EM></B>
