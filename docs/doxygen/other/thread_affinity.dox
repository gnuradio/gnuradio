/*! \page page_affinity Block Thread Affinity and Priority

\section affinity Block Thread Affinity

In the thread-per-block scheduler, you can set the block's core
affinity. Each block can be pinned to a group cores or be set back
to use the standard kernel scheduler.

The implementation is done by adding new functions to the threading
section of the gnuradio-runtime library:

\code
  gr::thread::gr_thread_t get_current_thread_id();
  void thread_bind_to_processor(unsigned int n);
  void thread_bind_to_processor(const std::vector<unsigned int> &mask);
  void thread_bind_to_processor(gr::thread::gr_thread_t thread, unsigned int n);
  void thread_bind_to_processor(gr::thread::gr_thread_t thread, const std::vector<unsigned int> &mask);
  void thread_unbind();
  void thread_unbind(gr::thread::gr_thread_t thread);
\endcode

The ability to set a thread's affinity to a core or groups of cores is
not implemented in the Boost thread library, and so we have made our
own portability library. In particular, the gr::thread::gr_thread_t type is
defined as the thread type for the given system. The other functions
are designed to be portable as well by calling the specific
implementation for the thread affinity for a particular platform.

There are functions to set a thread to a group of cores. If the thread
is not given, the current thread is used. If a single number is
passed, only that core is set (this is equivalent to a core mask with
just a single value).

Similarly, there are functions to unset the affinity. This practically
implements the setting of the thread's affinity to all possible
cores. Again, the function that does not take a thread argument unsets
the affinity for the current thread.

\subsection affinity_api GNU Radio Block API

Each block has two new data members:

- threaded: a boolean value that is true if the block is attached to a
  thread.
- thread: a gr::thread::gr_thread_t handle to the block's thread.

A block can set and unset its affinity at any time using the
following member functions:

- gr::block::set_processor_affinity(const std::vector<int> &mask)
- gr::block::unset_processor_affinity()

Where \p mask is a vector of core numbers to set the thread's affinity
to.

The current core affinity can be retrieved using the member function:

- gr::block::processor_affinity()

When set before the flowgraph is started, the scheduler will set the
thread's affinity when it is started. When already running, the
block's affinity will be immediately set.


\subsection affinity_api_hier Setting Affinity for a gr::hier_block2

A hierarchical block (gr::hier_block2) also has a concept of setting
the block thread affinity. Because the hierarchical block itself does
no work and just encapsulates a set of blocks, setting the
hierarchical block's affinity individually sets all blocks inside it
to that affinity setting.

The gr::hier_block2 class supports the same API interface to the block
thread affinity:

- gr::hier_block2::set_processor_affinity(const std::vector<int> &mask)
- gr::hier_block2::unset_processor_affinity()
- gr::hier_block2::processor_affinity()

Setting and unsetting the affinity does so recursively for every block
in the hierarchical block. It is of course possible to individually set
the affinity to any block underneath the hierarchical block. However,
in this case, note that when asking for the current affinity value
using 'processor_affinity()', the code returns the current processor
affinity value of only the first block.


\subsection affinity_api_grc GRC Access

GRC supports the setting of the thread core affinity in a block's
options. Each block now has a field 'Core Affinity' that accepts a
vector (list) of integers and sets the affinity after the block is
constructed.

Note that GRC does not provide a callback function for changing the
thread core affinity while the flowgraph is running.



\section priority_api Setting Thread Priority

Similarly to setting the core affinity for a given block, we can also
set the thread priority. This concept adds three new function calls to
all blocks:

\li gr::block::set_thread_priority(int priority): Sets the current thread priority.
\li gr::block::active_thread_priority(): Gets the active priority for the thread.
\li gr::block::thread_priority(): Gets the stored thread priority.

The range of the thread priority might be system dependent, so look to
your system/OS documentation. Linux specifies this range in
\b sched_setscheduler as a value between 1 and 99 where 1 is the lowest
priority and 99 is the highest. POSIX systems can retrieve these min
and max values using \b sched_get_priority_min and \b
sched_get_priority_max and may only allow 32 distinct values to be
set.
