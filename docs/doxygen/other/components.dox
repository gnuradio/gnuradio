\section components_blocks GNU Radio Blocks

GNU Radio uses discrete signal processing blocks that are connected
together to perform your signal processing application. This manual
contain a list of all GNU Radio <a href="modules.html"><b>C++ Blocks</b></a>,
sorted by category.

Please note that at this time, we haven't found an acceptable way to
provide unified documentation for the C++ parts of the system and the
parts written in Python (mostly hierarchical blocks).  Until this gets
worked out, please bear with us, or better yet, solve it for us!
