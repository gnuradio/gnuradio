This recipe is primarily used for CI builds, although it is possible to use it
locally from a checked-out git repository with "conda-build".

Developers
**********

CI builds use this recipe and the settings in .conda/conda-forge.yml. Any changes
to the recipe should be accompanied by running

    conda-smithy rerender --feedstock_config .conda/conda-forge.yml -c auto
    git rm -f .github/workflows/automerge.yml .github/workflows/webservices.yml .circleci/config.yml
    git commit --amend -s

so that the generated build scripts are updated when necessary.
***** RUN THE ABOVE TO CHECK FOR UPDATES WHENEVER EDITS ARE MADE in .conda *****

You can also re-render from a pull request by starting a comment with "/rerender", which will trigger a Github workflow to perform the above steps.

The CI will build conda packages for commits and pull requests, and it will
upload the packages to Anaconda Cloud on commits to the branch specified
in the configuration below. The channel and label that the packages are
uploaded to are set in the recipe directory in conda_build_config.yaml.
Uploads to Anaconda Cloud also require an API token to be set to the
BINSTAR_TOKEN environment variable. Documentation for token generation:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anacondaorg/user-guide/tasks/work-with-accounts/#creating-access-tokens
To populate BINSTAR_TOKEN for CI jobs, add the token as a secret, e.g.:
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
