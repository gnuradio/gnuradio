     * \brief Creates the encoder block for use in GNU Radio
     * flowgraphs with async message from a given FEC API object
     * derived from the generic_encoder class.

     * \details
     *
     * Encodes frames received as async messages or as a PDU over a
     * message port. This encoder works off a full message as one
     * frame or block to encode. The message length is used as the
     * frame length. To support this, the encoder variable used will
     * have had its frame_size set. This block treats that initial
     * frame_size value as the maximum transmission unit (MTU) and
     * will not process frames larger than that.
     *
     * This deployment works off messages and expects them to either
     * be messages full of unpacked bits or PDU messages, which means
     * full bytes of a frame from the higher layers, including things
     * like headers, tails, CRC check bytes, etc. For handling PDUs,
     * set the \p packed option of this deployment block to True. The
     * block will then use the FEC API to properly unpack the bits
     * from the PDU, pass it through the encoder, and repack them to
     * output the PDUs for the next stage of processing.
     *
     * The packed PDU form of this deployment is designed to work well
     * with other PDU-based blocks to operate within the processing
     * flow of data packets or frames.
     *
     * Due to differences in how data is packed and processed, this
     * block also offers the ability to change the direction of how
     * bits are unpacked and packed, where reading or writing from the
     * LSB or MSB. By default, the \p rev_unpack and \p rev_pack modes
     * are set to True. Using this setup allows the async block to
     * behave with PDUs in the same operation and format as the tagged
     * stream encoders. That is, putting the same data into both the
     * tagged stream encoder deployment and this with these default
     * settings should produce the same data.
