 * \brief Convolutional Code Decoding class.
 * \ingroup error_coding_blk
 *
 * \details
 * This class performs convolutional decoding via the Viterbi
 * algorithm. While it is set up to take variable values for K,
 * rate, and the polynomials, currently, the block is only
 * capable of handling the following settings:
 *
 * \li K = 7
 * \li rate = 1/2 (given as 2 to the constructor)
 * \li polynomials = [109, 79]
 *
 * This is the well-known convolutional part of the Voyager code
 * implemented in the CCSDS encoder.
 *
 * The intent of having this FECAPI code classes fully
 * parameterizable is to eventually allow it to take on generic
 * settings, much like the cc_encoder class where the CCSDS
 * settings would be a highly-optimized version of this.
 *
 * The decoder is set up with a number of bits per frame in the
 * constructor. When not being used in a tagged stream mode,
 * this encoder will only process frames of the length provided
 * here. If used in a tagged stream block, this setting becomes
 * the maximum allowable frame size that the block may process.
 *
 * The \p mode is a cc_mode_t that specifies how the convolutional
 * encoder will behave and under what conditions.
 *
 * \li 'CC_STREAMING': mode expects an uninterrupted flow of
 * samples into the encoder, and the output stream is
 * continually encoded. This mode is the only mode for this
 * decoder that has a history requirement because it requires
 * rate*(K-1) bits more to finish the decoding properly. This
 * mode does not work with any deployments that do not allow
 * history.
 *
 * \li 'CC_TERMINATED': is a mode designed for packet-based
 * systems. This mode adds rate*(k-1) bits to the output as a
 * way to help flush the decoder.
 *
 * \li 'CC_TAILBITING': is another packet-based method. Instead of
 * adding bits onto the end of the packet, this mode will
 * continue the code between the payloads of packets by
 * pre-initializing the state of the new packet based on the
 * state of the last packet for (k-1) bits.
 *
 * \li 'CC_TRUNCATED': a truncated code always resets the registers
 * to the \p start_state between frames.
 *
 * A common convolutional encoder uses K=7, Rate=1/2,
 * Polynomials=[109, 79]. This is the Voyager code from NASA:
 * \li   109: b(1101101) --> 1 + x   + x^3 + x^4 + x^6
 * \li   79:  b(1001111) --> 1 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6
