/*!
 * \brief BER block in FECAPI
 * \ingroup error_coding_blk
 *
 * \details
 *
 * This block measures the bit error rate between two streams of
 * packed data. It compares the bits of each streams and counts
 * the number of incorrect bits between them. It outputs the log
 * of the bit error rate, so a value of -X is 10^{-X} bit errors.
 *
 * When the \p mode is set to false (default), it is in streaming
 * mode. This means that the output is constantly producing the
 * current value of the BER. In this mode, there is a single
 * output BER calculation per chunk of bytes passed to it, so
 * there is no exact timing between calculations of BER. In this
 * mode, the other two parameters to the constructor are ignored.
 *
 * When \p mode is true, the block is in test mode. This mode is
 * used in the ber_curve_gen example and for other offline
 * analysis of BER curves. Here, the block waits until at least \p
 * berminerrors are observed and then produces a BER
 * calculation. The parameter \p ber_limit helps make sure that
 * the simulation is controlled. If the BER calculation drops
 * below the \p ber_limit setting, the block will exit and simply
 * return the set limit; the real BER is therefore some amount
 * lower than this.
 *
 * Note that this block takes in data as packed bytes with 8-bits
 * per byte used. It outputs a stream of floats as the log-scale BER.
