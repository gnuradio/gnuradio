     * \brief BER block in FECAPI
     * \ingroup error_coding_blk
     *
     * \details
     *
     * This block measures the bit error rate between two streams of
     * packed data. It compares the bits of each streams and counts
     * the number of incorrect bits between them. It outputs the log
     * of the bit error rate, so a value of -X is 10^{-X} bit errors.
     *
     * When the \p mode is set to false (default), it is in streaming
     * mode. This means that the output is constantly producing the
     * current value of the BER. In this mode, there is a single
     * output BER calculation per chunk of bytes passed to it, so
     * there is no exact timing between calculations of BER. In this
     * mode, the other two parameters to the constructor are ignored.
     *
     * When \p mode is true, the block is in test mode. This mode is
     * used in the ber_curve_gen example and for other offline
     * analysis of BER curves. Here, the block waits until at least \p
     * berminerrors are observed and then produces a BER
     * calculation. The parameter \p ber_limit helps make sure that
     * the simulation is controlled. If the BER calculation drops
     * bellow the \p ber_limit setting, the block will exit and simply
     * return the set limit; the real BER is therefore some amount
     * lower than this.
     *
     * Note that this block takes in data as packed bytes with 8-bits
     * per byte used. It outputs a stream of floats as the log-scale BER.
