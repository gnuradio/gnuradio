This is the gr-fec package. It contains all of the FEC
encoders and decoders. To use the FEC blocks, the Python
namespace is in gnuradio.fec, which would be normally
imported as:

    from gnuradio import fec

See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:

    help(fec)
