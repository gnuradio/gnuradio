## [3.8.0.0-rc1] - 2019-07-17

This is the release candidate for GNU Radio 3.8.

For brevity reasons, this document does NOT contain a complete CHANGELOG
comparing 3.8.0.0 to 3.7.0, because the development model changed underway, and
there's no human-feasible way to detangle the changes from more than six years
of development.

The major user-relevant changes will be noted here in the actual release.

What we can do here is point out that we've got a glorious amount of 215
individual contributors that added at least one commit since 3.7.0.

This is a **big** step towards the future of the world's most popular FOSS SDR
framework.

Let us ride eternal, shiny and chrome.
