## [3.10.0.0] - Unreleased

### Changed

- Moved PDU blocks from gr-blocks to gr-network and gr-pdu
   - Compatibility shim included to allow access to these blocks from gr-blocks
     but these are deprecated from the gr-blocks namespace and the shim is
     scheduled for removal in 3.11.
- gr::blocks::pdu namespace has been reorganized in gr
   - PDU vector types are accessible in gr::types
   - PDU functions are accessible in gr::pdu
   - Common msg port names are accessible in gr::ports

#### Project Scope

- C++17
  - requires MSVC 1914 (Microsoft VS 2017 15.7)
- Windows build: removed unnecessary MSVC-specific system include overrides

#### gr-analog

- `fastnoise_source`: Use `uint64_t` seed API, use `size_t` for vector length/indices
- `fastnoise_source`: Use a simple bitmask if the random pool length is a power
  of 2 to determine indices, instead of `%`, which consumed considerable CPU

#### gnuradio-runtime

- `gr::random` uses xoroshiro128+ internally, takes `uint64_t` seed

### Added

- New in-tree module gr-pdu

#### Misc.

- dtools: Added run-clang-tidy-on-codebase, which does what the name suggests,
  then updates all bindtool hashes, and commits everything appropriately

## [3.9.0.0] - 2020-01-17

### Changed

#### Project Scope

- **We now require commits to be signed off (DCO)**; this means you have to
attach `-s` to your `git commit` command line
- License headers now SPDX format
- C++14
 - use C++11 facilities in a lot of places where Boost was still used,
   especially smart pointers, range loops
 - lambdas where `boost::bind` was used
- C11
- Dependency versions:
  - Python 3.6.5
  - numpy 1.13.3
  - VOLK 2.4.1
  - CMake 3.10.2
  - Boost 1.65
  - Mako 1.0.7
  - PyBind11 2.4.3
- Compiler options:
  - GCC 8.3.0
  - Clang 11.0.0 / Apple Clang 1100
  - MSVC 1910 (Microsoft VS 2017 15.0)
- VOLK now "regular" dependency, not in-tree submodule
- numpy now also a CMake-checked hard dependency for Python support
- Exception Handling: throw by value, catch by reference (clang-tidy check)
- C++11: Emplace in vectors where you can; brings performance boni, but not
  included in clang-tidy-checks
- Further clang-tidy based code optimizations:
- empty() instead of size() == 0
- override where overriding virtual functions (which we do a lot)
- Logging: removed all `std::cerr` and `fprintf(stderr,…)` by GNU Radio logging
- Logging: Changed logging format for many multiline error logs
- purged `snprintf`, `printf` logging
- There were a lot of places where a malloc'ed object was used internally, where
  that was inappropriate. Using simple instance-holding fields now.
- `const` for members that were only set at construction time is now desired,
  and implemented in most places
- `const` -> `constexp` in a lot of places.
- `assert` -> `static_assert`
- An exception-throwing block will now terminate the flow graph process,
  configurable through `top_block`
- `gr-utils` cleanup, folder restructuring
- config version checks installed CMake file will accept "at least this version"
  now
- PyBind11 replaces SWIG
  - Full tree conversion from SWIG to Pybind11 bindings
- Doxygen now uses MathJax, full LaTeX installation no longer required

**NOTE**: Most of the changes above change the generally preferred coding style
in a lot of situations.

## [3.8.0.0] - 2019-08-09

Witness me!

Tonight, we release GNU Radio 3.8.0.0.

It's the first minor release version since more than six years, not without
pride this community stands to face the brightest future SDR on general purpose
hardware ever had.

Since we've not been documenting changes in the shape of a Changelog for the
whole of the development that happened since GNU Radio 3.7.0, I'm afraid that
these release notes will be more of a GLTL;DR (git log too long; didn't read)
than a detailed account of what has changed.

What has _not** changed is the fact that GNU Radio is centered around a very
simple truth:

> Let the developers hack on DSP. Software interfaces are for humans, not the
> other way around.

And so, compared to the later 3.7 releases, nothing has fundamentally modified
the way one develops signal processing systems with GNU Radio: You write blocks,
and you combine blocks to be part of a larger signal processing flow graph.

With that as a success story, we of course have faced quite a bit of change in
the systems we use to develop and in the people that develop GNU Radio. This has
lead to several changes that weren't compatible with 3.7.

**This is an excerpt only:**

### Fixed

#### Project Scope

- Roughly 36 dBBug, (ETOOMANYBUGS)
- Fixed .so versioning

### Changed

#### Project Scope

- C++11
- merged the wholeness of the `next` branch
- Dependency version bumps: CMake, GCC, MSVC, Swig, Boost
- New dependencies: MPIR/GMP, Qt5, gsm, codec2
- Removed dependencies: libusb, Qt4, CppUnit
- Python: Python 2 & Python 3 compatible. 3.8 will be the last Py2k-compatible
  release series
- gengen was replaced by templates (if you don't know gengen, don't do any
  research; save yourself that sorrow)
- Modern CMake (as far as feasible at this point)
- VOLK version updated to v2.0.0
- .clang-format file now dictates coding style
- clang-format'ed the whole tree.
- installed CMake files now tell about configuration

#### gnuradio-runtime

- reworked fractional tag time handling, especially in the context of resamplers

#### GRC

- C++ generation as option
- YAML instead of XML
- removed `blks2`
- much better canvas tooling
- consistent gobject usage
- ROUNDED ARROWS

#### gr-qtgui

- moving from Qt4 to Qt5

#### gr-utils

- `gr_modtool` now vastly improved

#### gr-vocoder

- improved versatility
- removed in-tree libgsm, libcodec2, use system-wide libs


### Removed

#### Project Scope
- Modules `gr-comedi`, `gr-fcd` and `gr-wxgui` are gone

#### gr-comedi

- nobody could remember who used this, or for what. It has seen 0 active code
  contributions in the 3.7 lifecycle

#### gr-digital

- python-based `packet_encoder` and related tools: Bugs that were sporadic and
  never fixed, so after long deprecation, we're removing it

#### gr-fcd

- since it's currently untestable by the CI, it's being removed, as there was no
  code contributions. Generally, we strive to include all batteries with GNU
  Radio. Re-integration within a more general SDR interface would be desirable.

#### gr-utils

- removed PyQwt (dead) based tools

#### gr-wxgui

- Unmaintained, breaks on increasingly many systems, always was slower than
  Qtgui. We've been starting to tell people to migrate to Qt since at
  least 2015. Now, we're finally removing it.
