# Changelog
All notable changes to GNU Radio will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), starting with version 3.7.12.0.

Older Logs can be found in `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-*`.

## unreleased

### Fixed
#### Project Scope
- `boost::posix_time::[milli]second` takes integer numbers, and we now at least cast the floats to integers, as Boost 1.67 forced us to realize we're (incorrectly) using floating point her
- CMake: using regex to match compiler against "Clang" now enables correct build on OS X
#### GRC
- Fixed GRC bug which made broke WX and Qt (by altering the template code)

## [3.7.12.0] - 2018-04-01

### Software Engineering
- Changed Changelog format
- Introducing Semantic Versioning
- Change of development model: Rather than merging bugfixes to maint, merging maint to master, and next, if applicable, we'll be moving forward more in a typical management model: Development happens on master, and bugfixes are cherrypicked onto the maint-${RELEASE} branch. More info: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnuradio/2018-02/msg00133.html
- First attempt at having a .clang-format file to improve code contribution style quality. This is Work In Progress.

### Fixed
#### Project Scope
- Buildability on systems where custom CMake command would try to find "" (empty string) as executable
- Buildable with C++11 compilers (though deprecation warning-rich, due to `unique_ptr`)

- Unit test/QA now parallelizable
- Logger works with log4cpp <= 1.1.2 both in and out of tree
- Python linkage under MinGW64

- New tag propagation policy "custom" for own implementation
- `get_tags_in_range` used `v.resize(0)` to clear vectors, which lead to unnecessary memory reallocations
