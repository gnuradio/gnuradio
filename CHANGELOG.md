## [3.10.7.0] - 2023-07-15

### Changed

#### Runtime
- Setting the minimum buffer size should have the desired effect now, and
not be overwritten. NOTE: the value returned by min_buffer_size() is not
intended to indicate the actual buffer size. Header Payload Demod was the
only block attempting to use this value, and was corrected.
- Use a set to store thread group (more efficient)
- Message Debug can now output via the logging system
- The field prefs.singleton is no longer externally exposed (was unintentional)
- PMT dict can be generated more easily using pmt::dict_from_mapping()

#### GRC
- Save changes under all exit conditions (a couple were previously missed)
- Prevent silent Generate/Run failures for unsaved flowgraphs

#### Testing
- Add Fedora 38, using the clang compiler
- Remove EOL Fedora 36

#### gr-analog
- C++ code generation for Quadrature Demod
- Add max_gain parameter for AGC

#### gr-blocks
- Probe Rate adds a name parameter, for clearer logging
- Selector has a new "sync" more that consumes the same number of items from all
inputs. Default is now to consume as many items as possible from the active input,
and no more than that many items from other inputs. The previous behavior was, well,
broken.
- Throttle reset item count on restart, to avoid long delays

#### gr-digital
- Constellation Encoder and Decoder: constellation can be changed at runtime

#### gr-filter
- Filter design tool: multiple improvements in bounds checking and exception handling

- Add Python loggers to top_block and hier_block2
- Change the default log level (in the config file) to INFO instead of DEBUG
- Logging improvements in the scheduler
- Correctly determine native page size for Windows

#### GRC
- Fixed: opening the source of a hierachical block using the toolbar button produced an error
- Use the logger, instead of print statements, in generated top blocks
- Remove libX11 load from generated Python code - this was unncessary and produced warnings
- Choose Editor dialog stays above parent

#### gr-analog
- Signal Source: option to hide the message port

#### gr-blocks
- Throttle: supports max time or number of samples per work iteration, useful for reducing latency at low sample rates

#### gr-fec
- Tagged Decoder: correctly calculate the frame size for terminated CC decoder

#### gr-filter
- Fixed reverse parameters in fir_filter_with_buffer and pfb_arb_resampler, which could cause crashes
- Fixed PFB Arbitrary Resampler was ignoring attenuation parameter

#### gr-iio
- Set gain mode as specified (was always manual)
- Use the specified gain parameter for second channel (was same as first channel)

#### gr-qtgui
- Histogram Sink: calculate range of bins correctly to avoid strange distributions
- Save (to image) dialogs add file extensions and have a Save button (i.e., they work now)

#### gr-soapy

- Stream sources produce when available, instead of waiting for a buffer to fill, helping with latency

#### Modtool
- Use interp and decim keywords correctly when generating blocks

#### Build system and packaging
- Uninstall removes icons and desktop files


## [3.10.5.1] - 2023-01-25

Some important blocks turned out to be broken in 3.10.5.0. This unscheduled release fixes those regressions and includes a small number of other cleanups and fixes. v3.10.5.1 is intended to be ABI compatible with v3.10.5.0. We'd still recommend rebuilding dependent packages, if possible.

### Changed

#### Runtime

- Add Python snipped hook point at "init before blocks", right before blocks are instantiated.

#### gr-audio
- Remove support for OSX 10.3 and earlier.

#### gr-digital
- Make tags visible to subclasses of OFDM Frame Equalizer.

#### gr-dtv
- Correct constant in DVBS2 Modulator.

#### gr-fec

- Fix crash in UDP Source when buffer overruns.

#### gr-qtgui
- Remove support for QWT 6.0 and earlier.

#### gr-uhd
- Add async message port to USRP Source and publish overflow notifications.

### Changed

#### Runtime
- Python block have access to the block logger, as in C++
- Default log level changed to INFO (from OFF)
- Memory-based logger `gr.dictionary_logger_backend()` added for log debugging
- API Note: The Python block gateway is now completely implemented in the PyBind11 wrapper, in order to clean up Python dependencies. This is technically an API change, but should not have any external effect.
- PMT serialization of Complex32 vectors is now `REAL | IMAG` on all platforms
- Python IO signature replication (multiple ports specified by one signature) fixed

#### GRC
- Continue processing block connections after a connection error occurs
- Drawing/scaling fixes that improve user experience on HiDPI and Windows machines

#### Build system and packaging
- Many deprecation warnings fixed
- Make target link libraries PRIVATE wherever possible, removing unnecessary downstream dependencies
- Add Fedora 37 and drop Fedora 35 CI targets
- Conda re-rendered with more recent packages - thanks to Ryan Volz for making Conda an easy-to-use, cross-platform method of installing GNU Radio
- Debian and Fedora packaging specs are no longer included in the code base, since they were out of date, and are maintained by downstreams

#### Testing
- Code formatting rules for clang format updated to v14
- Removed all compiler warning suppression
- Enable Python block testing for Conda on macOS
- Many other improvements that make maintenance easier - thanks again to Clayton Smith. In the process of fixing tests, a number of latent bugs were fixed throughout the code.

- CTCSS detection of standard tones improved by fixing floating point comparison

#### gr-blocks
- Probe Signal cross platform reliability improved by better thread synchronization

#### gr-digital
- CRC32 and CRC16 blocks use little-endian order regardless of host order. This is a wire format change. The options were to have different endian machines unable to communicate, or older and newer versions unable to communicate. Note that there is a more general set of blocks (CRC Append and CRC Check) that are recommended for use wherever possible.
- Packet headers use consistent bit order across machines
- Floating point/rounding fix in constellation lookup table

#### gr-fec
- LDPC G matrix `n` and `k` can be access from Python
- LDPC matrix output size calculation corrected

## [3.10.2.0] - 2022-04-09

### Changed

#### Project Scope

- Clayton Smith continues the effort to replace Boost usage with modern C++ equivalents. In a related effort, he has continued the logging modernization started by Marcus Müller. In his spare time, he has tackled some tricky, intermittent CI failures, some of which turned out to be real bugs. Much of this work is invisible to end users, but is extremely useful in making GNU Radio more reliable and maintainable. Special thanks are due to Clayton for a lot of hard work this cycle.
- Use exceptions instead of `exit()` in several places.
- Fixed a variety of Python deprecation warnings.
- Packager note: `jsonschema` is required for the JSON Config and YAML Config blocks. Those blocks will be disabled if `jsonschema` is not found.

#### gnuradio-runtime

- Correct size/usage for single-mapped buffers (part of the new Custom Buffers feature).
- Correct buffer size allocation. This was actually the single change in v3.10.1.1, which did not get its own CHANGELOG entry.

#### GRC

- Improve discovery of xterm and related programs.
- Save generated hierarchical block code to the block library instead of the directory containing the current GRC flowgraph.
- New JSON Config and YAML Config blocks that load configuration variables from files at runtime. Those variables may then be used in block parameters.
- Store the GNU Radio version in flowgraph metadata when saving.
- Minor change in Python evaluation code to allow `affinity`, `minoutbuf` and `maxoutbuf` to be adjusted via script parameters.


#### Build system and packaging

- Require C++-17 for `gnuradio-runtime` and code compiled against it (via cmake flags).
- Add `pythonschema` to build- and run-time dependencies.

#### gr-blocks

- Add exponential distribution to Message Strobe Random block's `delay` selection.
- Quiet down debug messages in File Sink.
- Skip alignment check in File Source when the input file is not seekable (e.g., it is a pipe).

#### gr-filter

- Fix crash in Rational Resampler logging

#### gr-digital

- Add generic CRC blocks: CRC Append and CRC Check.

#### gr-qtgui

- Improve text/background color on Range widget.
- Digital Number Control emits message with new, instead of previous, value.
- Message Edit Box sends message only when return is pressed, rather than whenever focus is lost.
- Vector Sink allows legend to be disabled.
- Type error fixes (Python 3.10 is stricter about int casting).

#### gr-trellis

- Provide Python bindings for PCCC Encoder and Viterbi Combo.

#### gr-vocoder

- Add C++ generation support to gr-vocoder

#### Code generation tools

- Support strongly-typed enums in Python bindings

## [3.10.1.0] - 2022-01-29

This is mostly a bug fix release. It is API compatible with 3.10.X.Y releases. Code built against GNU Radio libraries (including OOTs) will likely need to be recompiled, as ABI compatibility is not guaranteed.

### Changed

#### Runtime

- Add ownership and locking to hier_block2 to avoid crash/freeze after disconnect.

#### gr-analog

- Fix C++ code generation for random_uniform_source

#### gr-blocks

- Minimal implementation of a SigMF Sink, allowing users to easily try out generation SigMF output. SigMF uses a raw data file and a separate JSON metadata file. A SigMF Source is also provided. At this time, it is a wrapper around a File Source (the data files are compatible), but metadata is not processed.

#### gr-filter

- Bug fix: buses should now work with PFB channelizer and synthesizer.

#### gr-iio

- Various fixes for fmcomms2/3/4.

#### gr-uhd

- Bug fix: overflow count was uninitialized.
- Correct descriptor names in uhd_fpga_ddc/duc.

#### GRC

- Bug fix: initialize value for "priority" parameter in Python Snippets.
- Show blocks with "deprecated" flags as deprecated.

## [3.10.0.0] - 2022-01-14

It is with much excitement that we release the next step forward for GNU Radio - 3.10.0.0!

Not only does this release bring in some extremely useful new modules (gr-iio, gr-pdu, and arguably gr-soapy thought that thankfully made it also into recent 3.9 maintenance releases), but also sets a path forward for using GNU Radio in heterogeneous compute environments by providing "custom buffers" for more efficiently interacting with accelerators (GPUS, FPGAs, TPUs, etc.).

We have been fortunate this year to have extremely active backporting and consistent maintenance releases from co-maintainter Jeff Long - so many of the fixes and smaller feature (and larger ones) have already seen the light of day in the 3.9.x.x and even 3.8.x.x releases.

A special specific thanks to the contributors that made these larger features and upstreamed modules possible, but much appreciation to all that contributed through code, documentation, review, and just generally being a part of this wonderful community.
- gr-pdu: Jacob Gilbert and the team at Sandia National Labs
- gr-iio: Travis Collins and the team at Analog Devices as well as Adam Horden, David Winter, and Volker Shroer for bringing this in-tree and working through many of the complexities.
- Custom Buffers Support: We have David Sorber to thank for this incredible, yet advanced, feature that came out of the DARPA SDR 4.0 program and should get a lot of traction.  Check out https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Custom_Buffers for more of the gory detail.  Also thanks to Seth Hitefield whose initial work in this area helped get this concept into the mainstream for GNU Radio.
-  Logging Infrastructure Overhaul: A huge thanks to Marcus Müller for fixing all of this up, replacing Log4CPP with spdlog and also for providing ongoing architectural leadership to the project

### Changed

- Moved PDU blocks from gr-blocks to gr-network and gr-pdu
   - Compatibility shim included to allow access to these blocks from gr-blocks
     but these are deprecated from the gr-blocks namespace and the shim is
     scheduled for removal in 3.11.

## [3.9.2.0] - 2021-06-10

### Changed

#### SoapySDR support (gr-soapy)
The new gr-soapy built-in module provides access to Soapy hardware drivers using the SoapySDR driver framework. See https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Soapy for more information.

If SoapySDR 0.7.2 or newer is available during GNU Radio configuration, the gr-soapy module will be enabled.

The SoapySDR framework and Soapy driver modules are not maintained by the GNU Radio project. Driver modules are dynamically discovered and linked. They may be added and updated independently from the GNU Radio release cycle.

#### GRC

- Parameter expressions and/or values can be displayed in blocks on the flowgraph. Previously, only values were displayed. Look for the "Show Parameter ..." toggles under the View menu.
- Deprecated blocks are shown in a distinct color (orange), and the optional `deprecated` property has been added to block yaml
- Dark theme works better, especially for parameter fields
- Vector length is now correctly applied to all input ports
- Validation has been improved. Raw types are validated. Port connections are checked by type rather than by item size.
- Variable names that cause name conflicts in Python code (e.g., with package names) are rejected
- Bus logic fixes
- Blocks can no longer be dragged off the screen and lost forever

#### gnuradio-runtime

- Remove `pmt::pmt_*` functions, which were not actually implemented. This is technically an API change, but any use of the API would have resulted in a link error.
- Remove Python bindings for internal buffer functions

#### gr-analog

- Added an example for PLL Frequency Detector
- Better names for parameters in PLL GRC blocks

#### gr-blocks

- Consistent naming for Vector Length parameter in GRC blocks
- `count_bits` uses VOLK `popcnt` for better performance (used for example in the Correlate Access Code block)
- Rotator block phase increment parameter is controllable via a message, and a tag can be added at the point where the increment is adjusted

#### gr-digital

- MPSK example updated to use a Linear Equalizer (replacing deprecated block)

#### gr-filter

- Filter Delay documentation improvement
- Interpolating FIR filter can generate C++ code

#### gr-dtv

- VL-SNR bugs fixed (incorrect constants).

#### gr-qtgui

- Improve autoscaling for vector sinks
- Fix floating-point resolution problems in several widgets, due to interpretation of PMT doubles as floats

#### gr-uhd

- Add policy enum to Python bindings for `tune_request`
- Additional time spec options on UHD blocks (PC Clock on Next PPS, GPS Time on Next PPS)
- Fix up code that was generating warnings
- Fix command handler logic to apply commands from messages to the correct channel

#### gr_filter_design

- "File/Save" is disabled until the taps have been computed, and the GUI is reset after a save, to make it clearer which data is being saved.
- Entries are hidden for parameters that do not apply to the selected filter type.
- Save window type as an integer instead of a Python enum name

#### gr_modtool

- Improve validation of module and block names

#### Build System and Infrastructure

- Improved messages related to dependencies MPIR and GMP. Only one of these packages is required, and the previous error messages were confusing.
- Cleaner builds for Windows and Conda. A number of general cmake improvements have resulted from this work.
- In-tree packaging files for DEB and RPM, used with Launchpad and COPR
- Added man pages for GNU Radio tools
- Test code generation for all in-tree GRC examples
- In GrPybind.cmake, `PYBIND11_INCLUDE_DIR` (incorrect) was changed to `pybind11_INCLUDE_DIR`

## [3.9.1.0] - 2021-03-17 "Luck-O-The-Radio"

API is compatible with C++ code written against previous v3.9 releases.

ABI (link time) compatibility is not guaranteed. Out-of-tree C++ code
linked to previous v3.9 releases should be rebuilt against this version.

### Project Scope
- (internal) Build system improvements and fixes
- (internal) Use C++14 features instead of Boost where possible
- Fewer compiler warnings (due to fixed code, not removal of warnings!)

### OOT Support
- cmake: standard FindGSL used in lieu of custom one, so OOTs should no longer
  copy this module from the GNU Radio tree if needed
- modtool: better exception/error handling
- modtool: will non-interactively add blocks with no parameters
  (`--argument-list=""`)
- PyBind11 header hash hotfixer
  (gr-utils/bindtool/scripts/binding-hash-hotfixer.zsh) makes life easier

### GRC
- Block param values can be shown as expressions and/or evaluated values. Under
  the View menu, see "Show parameter ..." options.
- Better handling of gui hints, avoid hiding widgets in cases where some have
  GUI hints and some do not
- Ensure that strings are valid utf8 when evaluating parameters
- Save embedded python blocks/modules to hier_block_directory
- Save config and update recent file sub-menu before executing flowgraph
- Revert to previous "block id" display behavior
- Fix drag n' drop issue with Quartz (macOS) backend
- C++ generated code: remove gnuradio prefix from linked libraries
- Python generated code: prefix generated modules with flowgraph id
- connect() will be called for hier blocks even if they don't have ports
- Check for PyYAML 3.11 (was checking for 3.10 even though 3.11 was required)

### gnuradio-runtime
- Default buffer size can be adjusted by setting `buffer_size` in the
`[Default]` section of the GNU Radio config file. Otherwise, the longstanding
  default of `32768` is used.
- Windows/Python: add DLL search path, as required by newer versions of Python

### gr-audio
- Windows: reduce priority of Windows native audio to LOW, preferring Portaudio

### gr-blocks
- Message Debug: prints warning when a non-PDU message is received on the
  Print PDU port
- File Source handles EOF properly in non-seekable files (e.g., pipes)
- Several bounds checking and boundary condition improvements
- Remove DC Spike AutoSync algorithm fixed

### gr-digital
- MSK timing error detector improvement
- Python bindings include control_loop parent class in child class
- Correlation Estimator parameter `threshold` well documented

### gr-fft
- New window types: Nuttall, Blackman Nuttall, Nuttall CFD, Welch, Parzen,
  Exponential, Riemann, Gaussian and Tukey

### gr-filter
- Taps blocks (e.g., Low Pass Filter Taps) now propagate parameter changes
- Filter Designer: IIR/Band Pass/Bessel works

### gr-qtgui
- Add toggling label and icon on plot play/stop button
- Time Raster Sink: axis labels and ranges are configurable
- Qt Chooser: label improvements

### gr-uhd
- DEPRECATION: UHD blocks currently accept control messages (e.g. for
  frequency change) as PMT pairs and tuples, in addition to the intended
  PMT dict format. In v3.11, only the dict format will be accepted.
- Command note: `freq` messages in this version must be dicts. Additionally,
  the `direction` key must be present and set to `TX` or `RX`.
  Python example: `pmt.to_pmt({'freq':100e6,'direction':'RX'})`
  The original behavior may be restored in an update, but code should be
  converted to use the dict format in preparation for future versions.
- `set_filter()` adds `chan` parameter
- Python generated code improved for FE corrections
- Allow control of frequency and gain in both directions at the same moment
- Add command handler for mtune ("manual tune")
- Add GPIO control via messages
- Add start time param to GRC blocks
- Support streaming modes: `STREAM_MODE_START_CONTINUOUS`,
  `STREAM_MODE_STOP_CONTINUOUS`, `STREAM_MODE_NUM_SAMPS_AND_DONE`,
  `STREAM_MODE_NUM_SAMPS_AND_MORE`
- Documentation improvements
- Tag sink demo example
- Better logging of over/underflows, time errors and time tags
- Added Python binding for ALL_LOS (all local oscillators)
- `uhd_fft` application X11/Qt related cleanups

### QA
- `waitFor(condition, ...)` available for tests that use timeouts

## [3.9.0.0] - 2020-01-17

The future is not set, there is no fate but what we make for ourselves. In this
very spirit, GNU Radio 3.9 packs a whole bunch of power when it comes to
transforming the way GNU Radio and its ecosytem can be developed in the future.

Not only did we have great progressions from old dependencies that proved to be
all too problematic (SWIG, Python2), but also did we see an incredibly influx of
people actively working on how maintainable this code base is. This will nurture
the project for years to come.

All in all, the main breaking change for pure GRC users will consist in a few
changed blocks – an incredible feat, considering the amount of shift under the
hood. Mentioning large shifts, the work that went into the PyBind binding, the
CMake modernization, the C++ cleanup, the bug-fixing and the CI infrastructure
is worthy of explicit call out; I especially thank

* Josh Morman
* Thomas Habets
* Jacob Gilbert
* Andrej Rode
* Ryan Volz

here.

For developers of OOTs, I'm sure PyBind11 will pose a surprise. If you're used
to SWIG, yes, that's more code to write yourself. But in effect, it's less code
that breaks, and when it breaks, it breaks in much more understandable ways.
Josh has put a lot of effort into automating as much of that as possible.
There's certainly no shortage of demand for that! The ecosystem (remember GNU
Radio's tagline?) is in a steady upwind. We've seen more, and more stable,
contributions from OOT maintainers. That's great!

For in-tree development, newer dependencies and removal of anachronisms will
make sure things move much smoother. Our CI is getting – lately literally every
day – better, which means we not only catch bugs earlier, but also allow for
much quicker review cycles.

One central change:

If you're contributing code upstream, we no longer need you to submit a CLA;
instead, we ask you to just certify, yourself, that you're allowed to contribute
that code (and not, e.g. misappropriating someone else's code).

That's what the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) is: Just a quick, "hey,
this code is actually for me to contribute under the project's license"; nothing
more.

Which means that our infrastructure will refuse to let your code into the tree
if you didn't add a

`Signed-off-by: Maxime Example <maxime@example.com>`

to your commit message. Luckily, git can do that for you: `git commit -s`.

### Changed

#### Project Scope

- **We now require commits to be signed off (DCO)**; this means you have to
attach `-s` to your `git commit` command line
- License headers now SPDX format
- C++14
 - use C++11 facilities in a lot of places where Boost was still used,
   especially smart pointers, range loops
 - lambdas where `boost::bind` was used
- C11
- Dependency versions:
  - Python 3.6.5
  - numpy 1.13.3
  - VOLK 2.4.1
  - CMake 3.10.2
  - Boost 1.65
  - Mako 1.0.7
  - PyBind11 2.4.3
- Compiler options:
  - GCC 8.3.0
  - Clang 11.0.0 / Apple Clang 1100
  - MSVC 1910 (Microsoft VS 2017 15.0)
- VOLK now "regular" dependency, not in-tree submodule
- numpy now also a CMake-checked hard dependency for Python support
- Exception Handling: throw by value, catch by reference (clang-tidy check)
- C++11: Emplace in vectors where you can; brings performance boni, but not
  included in clang-tidy-checks
- Further clang-tidy based code optimizations:
- empty() instead of size() == 0
- override where overriding virtual functions (which we do a lot)
- Logging: removed all `std::cerr` and `fprintf(stderr,…)` by GNU Radio logging
- Logging: Changed logging format for many multiline error logs
- purged `snprintf`, `printf` logging
- There were a lot of places where a malloc'ed object was used internally, where
  that was inappropriate. Using simple instance-holding fields now.
- `const` for members that were only set at construction time is now desired,
  and implemented in most places
- `const` -> `constexp` in a lot of places.
- `assert` -> `static_assert`
- An exception-throwing block will now terminate the flow graph process,
  configurable through `top_block`
- `gr-utils` cleanup, folder restructuring
- config version checks installed CMake file will accept "at least this version"
  now
- PyBind11 replaces SWIG
  - Full tree conversion from SWIG to Pybind11 bindings
- Doxygen now uses MathJax, full LaTeX installation no longer required

**NOTE**: Most of the changes above change the generally preferred coding style
in a lot of situations.

## [3.8.5.0] - 2022-01-XX

This is an API compatible update to GNU Radio 3.8. Code written for 3.8.X versions should compile and link without modification. The ABI is not guaranteed to be compatible, so a rebuild of OOT modules may be necessary.

#### GRC
- GRC now runs on Fedora 35 ... Gtk initialization checks were too strict
- Fix: dependent variables sometimes fail to evaluate

## [3.8.3.1] - 2021-06-10

This is a PATCH level revision. The API is compatible with C++ code written for previous v3.8 releases. ABI (shared library signature) is intended to be compatible, so code linked against v3.8.3.0 should not require recompilation.

### Changed

#### Build system

- Improved messages related to dependencies MPIR and GMP. Only one of these packages is required, and the previous error messages were confusing.

#### GRC

- Parameter expressions and/or values can be displayed in blocks on the flowgraph. Previously, only values were displayed. Look for the "Show Parameter ..." toggles under the View menu.
- Vector length is now correctly applied to all input ports.
- Validation has been improved. Raw types are validated. Port connections are checked by type rather than by item size.
- Variable names that cause conflicts in Python code (e.g., package names) are rejected.
- Bus logic fixes.
- Blocks can no longer be dragged off the screen and lost forever.

#### gr-dtv

- VL-SNR bugs fixed (incorrect constants).

#### gr-qtgui

- Improve autoscaling for vector sinks.

#### gr_filter_design

- "File/Save" is disabled until the taps have been computed, and the GUI is reset after a save, to make it clearer which data is being saved.
- Entries are hidden for parameters that do not apply to the selected filter type.

## [3.8.0.0] - 2019-08-09

Witness me!

Tonight, we release GNU Radio 3.8.0.0.

It's the first minor release version since more than six years, not without
pride this community stands to face the brightest future SDR on general purpose
hardware ever had.

Since we've not been documenting changes in the shape of a Changelog for the
whole of the development that happened since GNU Radio 3.7.0, I'm afraid that
these release notes will be more of a GLTL;DR (git log too long; didn't read)
than a detailed account of what has changed.

What has _not** changed is the fact that GNU Radio is centered around a very
simple truth:

> Let the developers hack on DSP. Software interfaces are for humans, not the
> other way around.

And so, compared to the later 3.7 releases, nothing has fundamentally modified
the way one develops signal processing systems with GNU Radio: You write blocks,
and you combine blocks to be part of a larger signal processing flow graph.

With that as a success story, we of course have faced quite a bit of change in
the systems we use to develop and in the people that develop GNU Radio. This has
lead to several changes that weren't compatible with 3.7.

**This is an excerpt only:**

### Fixed

#### Project Scope

- Roughly 36 dBBug, (ETOOMANYBUGS)
- Fixed .so versioning

### Changed

#### Project Scope

- C++11
- merged the wholeness of the `next` branch
- Dependency version bumps: CMake, GCC, MSVC, Swig, Boost
- New dependencies: MPIR/GMP, Qt5, gsm, codec2
- Removed dependencies: libusb, Qt4, CppUnit
- Python: Python 2 & Python 3 compatible. 3.8 will be the last Py2k-compatible
  release series
- gengen was replaced by templates (if you don't know gengen, don't do any
  research; save yourself that sorrow)
- Modern CMake (as far as feasible at this point)
- VOLK version updated to v2.0.0
- .clang-format file now dictates coding style
- clang-format'ed the whole tree.
- installed CMake files now tell about configuration

#### gnuradio-runtime

- reworked fractional tag time handling, especially in the context of resamplers

#### GRC

- C++ generation as option
- YAML instead of XML
- removed `blks2`
- much better canvas tooling
- consistent gobject usage
- ROUNDED ARROWS

#### gr-qtgui

- moving from Qt4 to Qt5

#### gr-utils

- `gr_modtool` now vastly improved

#### gr-vocoder

- improved versatility
- removed in-tree libgsm, libcodec2, use system-wide libs


### Removed

#### Project Scope
- Modules `gr-comedi`, `gr-fcd` and `gr-wxgui` are gone

#### gr-comedi

- nobody could remember who used this, or for what. It has seen 0 active code
  contributions in the 3.7 lifecycle

#### gr-digital

- python-based `packet_encoder` and related tools: Bugs that were sporadic and
  never fixed, so after long deprecation, we're removing it

#### gr-fcd

- since it's currently untestable by the CI, it's being removed, as there was no
  code contributions. Generally, we strive to include all batteries with GNU
  Radio. Re-integration within a more general SDR interface would be desirable.

#### gr-utils

- removed PyQwt (dead) based tools

#### gr-wxgui

- Unmaintained, breaks on increasingly many systems, always was slower than
  Qtgui. We've been starting to tell people to migrate to Qt since at
  least 2015. Now, we're finally removing it.
