         FIR lowpass filter length estimator.  freq1 and freq2 are
        normalized to the sampling frequency.  delta_p is the passband
        deviation (ripple), delta_s is the stopband deviation (ripple).

        Note, this works for high pass filters too (freq1 > freq2), but
        doesn't work well if the transition is near f == 0 or f == fs/2

        finite impulse response filters.  Bell System Technical J., 52, 769-99

        (n, fo, ao, w) = remezord (f, a, dev)
        (n, fo, ao, w) = remezord (f, a, dev, fs)

        (n, fo, ao, w) = remezord (f, a, dev) finds the approximate order,
        normalized frequency band edges, frequency band amplitudes, and
        weights that meet input specifications f, a, and dev, to use with
        the remez command.

        * f is a sequence of frequency band edges (between 0 and Fs/2, where
          Fs is the sampling frequency), and a is a sequence specifying the
          desired amplitude on the bands defined by f. The length of f is
          twice the length of a, minus 2. The desired function is
          piecewise constant.

        * dev is a sequence the same size as a that specifies the maximum
          allowable deviation or ripples between the frequency response
          and the desired amplitude of the output filter, for each band.

        Use remez with the resulting order n, frequency sequence fo,
        amplitude response sequence ao, and weights w to design the filter b
        which approximately meets the specifications given by remezord
        input parameters f, a, and dev:

        b = remez (n, fo, ao, w)

        (n, fo, ao, w) = remezord (f, a, dev, Fs) specifies a sampling frequency Fs.

        Fs defaults to 2 Hz, implying a Nyquist frequency of 1 Hz. You can
        therefore specify band edges scaled to a particular applications
        sampling frequency.

        In some cases remezord underestimates the order n. If the filter
        does not meet the specifications, try a higher order such as n+1
        or n+2.
