This is the gr-zeromq package. It contains all of the zeromq blocks,
utilities, and examples. To use the zeromq blocks, the Python
namespace is in gnuradio.zeromq, which would be normally imported as:

    from gnuradio import zeromq

See the Doxygen documentation for details about the blocks available
in this package. A quick listing of the details can be found in Python
after importing by using:
