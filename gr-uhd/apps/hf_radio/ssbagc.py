# post detection agc processing
#
# This agc strategy is copied more or less verbatim from
# weaver_isb_am1_usrp3.py by cswiger.
#
# Thanks.
#
# Then modified in a variety of ways.
#
# There doesn't appear to be a way to hook multiple blocks to the
# input port when building a hier block like this. Thus the
# split below.
#
# Basic operation.
# Power is estimated by squaring the input.
# Low pass filter using a 1 pole iir.
# The time constant can be tweaked by changing the taps.
# Currently there is no implementation to change this while operating
#   a potentially useful addition.
# The log block turns this into dB
# gain adjusts the agc authority.
