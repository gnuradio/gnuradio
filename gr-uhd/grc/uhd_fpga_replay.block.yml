  RFNoC replay block (FPGA Implementation).
  This instantiates the replay/capture block in the FPGA bitfile. This block
  requires access to DRAM, which is provided by the BSP. The number of ports,
  and the data and address widths are also dependent on the specific BSP
  configuration.
  Typically, this block is connected to its own set of streaming endpoints,
  although there is no requirement to do this. In that case, streaming endpoints
  may be configured with smaller buffer sizes since streaming into DRAM is less
  latency-sensitive than streaming directly to the radio block.
