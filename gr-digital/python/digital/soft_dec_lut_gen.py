def soft_dec_table_generator(soft_dec_gen, prec, Es=1):
    '''
    Builds a LUT that is a list of tuples. The tuple represents the
    soft decisions for the constellation/bit mapping at any given
    point in the complex space, (x,y).

    The table is built to a precision specified by the 'prec'
    argument. There are (2x2)^prec samples in the sample space, so we
    get the precision of 2^prec samples in both the real and imaginary
    axes.

    The space is represented where index 0 is the bottom left corner
    and the maximum index is the upper left. The table index for a
    surface space with 4 bits of precision looks like the following:

    240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 | 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255

    We then calculate coordinates from -1 to 1 with 2^prec points for
    both the x and y axes. We then sample starting at (-1, -1) and
    move left to right on the x-axis and then move up a row on the
    y-axis. For every point in this sampled space, we calculate the
    soft decisions for the given constellation/mapping. This is done
    by passing in the function 'soft_dec_gen' as an argument to this
    function. This takes in the x/y coordinates and outputs the soft
    decisions. These soft decisions are stored into the list at the
    index from the above table as a tuple.

    The function 'calc_from_table' takes in a point and reverses this
    operation. It converts the point from the coordinates (-1,-1) to
    (1,1) into an index value in the table and returns the tuple of
    soft decisions at that index.

    Es is the energy per symbol. This is passed to the function to
    provide the bounds when calling the generator function since they
    don't know how the constellation was normalized. Using the
    (maximum) energy per symbol for constellation allows us to provide
    any scaling of the constellation (normalized to sum to 1,
    normalized so the outside points sit on +/-1, etc.) but still
    calculate the soft decisions as we would given the full
    constellation.

    Similar in nature to soft_dec_table_generator above. Instead, this
    takes in the constellation and symbol points along with the noise
    power estimate and uses calc_soft_dec (below) to generate the
    LUT.

    Instead of assuming that the constellation is normalied (e.g., all
    points are between -1 and 1), this function calculates the min/max
    of both the real and imaginary axes and uses those when
    constructing the LUT. So when using this version of the LUT, the
    samples and the constellations must be working on the same
    magnitudes.

    Because this uses the calc_soft_dec function, it can be quite
    a bit more expensive to generate the LUT, though it should be
    one-time work.

    The function returns a vector of k soft decisions. Decisions less
