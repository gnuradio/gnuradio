     * Scramble an input stream using an LFSR.
     *
     * \details
     * This block works on the LSB only of the input data stream,
     * i.e., on an "unpacked binary" stream, and produces the same
     * format on its output.
     *
     * The scrambler works by XORing the incoming bit stream by the
     * output of the LFSR. Optionally, after 'count' bits have been
     * processed, the shift register is reset to the seed value.
     * This allows processing fixed length vectors of samples.
