     * \brief Frequency Lock Loop using band-edge filters
     * \ingroup synchronizers_blk
     *
     * \details
     * The frequency lock loop derives a band-edge filter that covers
     * the upper and lower bandwidths of a digitally-modulated
     * signal. The bandwidth range is determined by the excess
     * bandwidth (e.g., rolloff factor) of the modulated signal. The
     * placement in frequency of the band-edges is determined by the
     * oversampling ratio (number of samples per symbol) and the
     * excess bandwidth.  The size of the filters should be fairly
     * large so as to average over a number of symbols.
     *
     * The FLL works by filtering the upper and lower band edges into
     * x_u(t) and x_l(t), respectively.  These are combined to form
     * cc(t) = x_u(t) + x_l(t) and ss(t) = x_u(t) - x_l(t). Combining
     * these to form the signal e(t) = Re{cc(t) \\times ss(t)^*}
     * (where ^* is the complex conjugate) provides an error signal at
     * the DC term that is directly proportional to the carrier
     * frequency.  We then make a second-order loop using the error
     * signal that is the running average of e(t).
     *
     * In practice, the above equation can be simplified by just
     * comparing the absolute value squared of the output of both
     * filters: abs(x_l(t))^2 - abs(x_u(t))^2 = norm(x_l(t)) -
     * norm(x_u(t)).
     *
     * In theory, the band-edge filter is the derivative of the
     * matched filter in frequency, (H_be(f) = frac{H(f)}{df}). In
     * practice, this comes down to a quarter sine wave at the point
     * of the matched filter's rolloff (if it's a raised-cosine, the
     * derivative of a cosine is a sine).  Extend this sine by another
     * quarter wave to make a half wave around the band-edges is
     * equivalent in time to the sum of two sinc functions. The
     * baseband filter fot the band edges is therefore derived from
     * this sum of sincs. The band edge filters are then just the
     * baseband signal modulated to the correct place in
     * frequency. All of these calculations are done in the
     * 'design_filter' function.
     *
     * Note: We use FIR filters here because the filters have to have
     * a flat phase response over the entire frequency range to allow
     * their comparisons to be valid.
     *
     * It is very important that the band edge filters be the
     * derivatives of the pulse shaping filter, and that they be
     * linear phase. Otherwise, the variance of the error will be very
     * large.
