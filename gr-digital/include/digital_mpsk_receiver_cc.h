 * \brief This block takes care of receiving M-PSK modulated signals
 * through phase, frequency, and symbol synchronization.
 * \ingroup synchronizers_blk
 *
 * \details
 * This block takes care of receiving M-PSK modulated signals through
 * phase, frequency, and symbol synchronization. It performs carrier
 * frequency and phase locking as well as symbol timing recovery.  It
 * works with (D)BPSK, (D)QPSK, and (D)8PSK as tested currently. It
 * should also work for OQPSK and PI/4 DQPSK.
 *
 * The phase and frequency synchronization are based on a Costas loop
 * that finds the error of the incoming signal point compared to its
 * nearest constellation point. The frequency and phase of the NCO are
 * updated according to this error. There are optimized phase error
 * detectors for BPSK and QPSK, but 8PSK is done using a brute-force
 * computation of the constellation points to find the minimum.
 *
 * The symbol synchronization is done using a modified Mueller and
 * Muller circuit from the paper:
 *
 * "G. R. Danesfahani, T. G. Jeans, "Optimisation of modified Mueller
 * and Muller algorithm," Electronics Letters, Vol. 31, no. 13, 22
 * June 1995, pp. 1032 - 1033."
 *
 * This circuit interpolates the downconverted sample (using the NCO
 * developed by the Costas loop) every mu samples, then it finds the
 * sampling error based on this and the past symbols and the decision
 * made on the samples. Like the phase error detector, there are
 * optimized decision algorithms for BPSK and QPKS, but 8PSK uses
 * another brute force computation against all possible symbols. The
 * modifications to the M&M used here reduce self-noise.
