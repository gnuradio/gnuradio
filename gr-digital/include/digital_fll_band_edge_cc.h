 * \class digital_fll_band_edge_cc
 * \brief Frequency Lock Loop using band-edge filters
 * \ingroup synchronizers_blk
 *
 * \details
 * The frequency lock loop derives a band-edge filter that covers the
 * upper and lower bandwidths of a digitally-modulated signal. The
 * bandwidth range is determined by the excess bandwidth (e.g.,
 * rolloff factor) of the modulated signal. The placement in frequency
 * of the band-edges is determined by the oversampling ratio (number
 * of samples per symbol) and the excess bandwidth.  The size of the
 * filters should be fairly large so as to average over a number of
 * symbols.
 *
 * The FLL works by filtering the upper and lower band edges into
 * x_u(t) and x_l(t), respectively.  These are combined to form cc(t)
 * = x_u(t) + x_l(t) and ss(t) = x_u(t) - x_l(t). Combining these to
 * form the signal e(t) = Re{cc(t) \\times ss(t)^*} (where ^* is the
 * complex conjugate) provides an error signal at the DC term that is
 * directly proportional to the carrier frequency.  We then make a
 * second-order loop using the error signal that is the running
 * average of e(t).
 *
 * In practice, the above equation can be simplified by just comparing
 * the absolute value squared of the output of both filters:
 * abs(x_l(t))^2 - abs(x_u(t))^2 = norm(x_l(t)) - norm(x_u(t)).
 *
 * In theory, the band-edge filter is the derivative of the matched
 * filter in frequency, (H_be(f) = frac{H(f)}{df}). In practice,
 * this comes down to a quarter sine wave at the point of the matched
 * filter's rolloff (if it's a raised-cosine, the derivative of a
 * cosine is a sine).  Extend this sine by another quarter wave to
 * make a half wave around the band-edges is equivalent in time to the
 * sum of two sinc functions. The baseband filter fot the band edges
 * is therefore derived from this sum of sincs. The band edge filters
 * are then just the baseband signal modulated to the correct place in
 * frequency. All of these calculations are done in the
 * 'design_filter' function.
 *
 * Note: We use FIR filters here because the filters have to have a
 * flat phase response over the entire frequency range to allow their
 * comparisons to be valid.
 *
 * It is very important that the band edge filters be the derivatives
 * of the pulse shaping filter, and that they be linear
 * phase. Otherwise, the variance of the error will be very large.
