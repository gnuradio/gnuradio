 * \brief Least-Mean-Square Decision Directed Equalizer (complex in/out)
 * \ingroup equalizers_blk
 *
 * \details
 * This block implements an LMS-based decision-directed equalizer.
 * It uses a set of weights, w, to correlate against the inputs, u,
 * and a decisions is then made from this output. The error
 * in the decision is used to update teh weight vector.
 *
 * y[n] = conj(w[n]) u[n]
 * d[n] = decision(y[n])
 * e[n] = d[n] - y[n]
 * w[n+1] = w[n] + mu u[n] conj(e[n])
 *
 * Where mu is a gain value (between 0 and 1 and usualy small,
 * around 0.001 - 0.01.
 *
 * This block uses the digital_constellation object for making
 * the decision from y[n]. Create the constellation object for
 * whatever constellation is to be used and pass in the object.
 * In Python, you can use something like:
 *    self.constellation = digital.constellation_qpsk()
 * To create a QPSK constellation (see the digital_constellation
 * block for more details as to what constellations are available
 * or how to create your own). You then pass the object to this
 * block as an sptr, or using "self.constellation.base()".
 *
 * The theory for this algorithm can be found in Chapter 9 of:
 * S. Haykin, Adaptive Filter Theory, Upper Saddle River, NJ:
 *    Prentice Hall, 1996.
