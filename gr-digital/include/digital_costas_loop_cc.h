 * \brief A Costas loop carrier recovery module.

 *  
 * \details
 *  The Costas loop locks to the center frequency of a signal and
 *  downconverts it to baseband. The second (order=2) order loop is
 *  used for BPSK where the real part of the output signal is the
 *  baseband BPSK signal and the imaginary part is the error
 *  signal. When order=4, it can be used for quadrature modulations
 *  where both I and Q (real and imaginary) are outputted.
 *
 *  More details can be found online:
 *
 *  J. Feigin, "Practical Costas loop design: Designing a simple and
 *  inexpensive BPSK Costas loop carrier recovery circuit," RF signal
 *  processing, pp. 20-36, 2002.
