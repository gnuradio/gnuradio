Decoding ATSC using 6.4MSps rate
---------------------------------

1) Verify signal, adjust antenna and find best gain setting using uhd_fft.py,
station frequency from the fcc video database, and sample rate to 6.4e6.

2) Capture data - adjust gain (-g) frequency (-f) and which side
the daughterboard is on to fit your local setup:

uhd_rx_cfile.py -s --samp-rate=6.4e6 -g 65 -f 503e6 atsc_data_6-4m_complex

You probably still need fast disks to take the data, like a raid-0 set of
striped sata drives. Make sure there are no or very few Ou overruns. Saving
the raw usrp data in 'short' form halves the disk space/bus bandwidth that
the usual complex form uses.

3) Run atsc_rx.py:

./atsc_rx.py atsc_data_6-4m_complex outfile.ts
