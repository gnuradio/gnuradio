/*!
 * \brief abstract base class for ATSC field sync correlator
 *
 * Processes input samples one at a time looking for
 * an occurrence of either the field sync 1 or field sync 2 pattern.
 *
 * For each sample processed, an output sample and an output tag are produced.
 * The output samples are identical to the input samples but are delayed by
 * a number of samples given by \p delay().  The output tag associated with
 * the the given output sample indicates whether this sample is the beginning
 * of one of the field syncs or is an ordinary sample.  The tags are defined in
 * atsci_sync_tag.h.
 *
 * For ease of use, the field sync patterns are defined to begin with the
 * first symbol of the 4 symbol data segment sync pattern that immediately
 * proceeds the actual PN 511 code.  This makes it easier for downstream code
 * to determine the location of data segment syncs merely by counting.  They'll
 * occur every 832 samples assuming everything is working.
