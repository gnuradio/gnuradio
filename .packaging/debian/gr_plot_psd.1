.SH NAME
gr_plot_psd \- GNU Radio power spectrum plotting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gr_plot_psd:
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIinput_filename\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Takes a GNU Radio binary file (with specified data type using \fB\-\-data\-type\fR) and
displays the I&Q data versus time as well as the power spectral density (PSD)
plot. The y\-axis values are plotted assuming volts as the amplitude of the I&Q
streams and converted into dBm in the frequency domain (the 1/N power
adjustment out of the FFT is performed internally). The script plots a certain
block of data at a time, specified on the command line as \fB\-B\fR or \fB\-\-block\fR. The
start position in the file can be set by specifying \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-start\fR and defaults
to 0 (the start of the file). By default, the system assumes a sample rate of
1, so in time, each sample is plotted versus the sample number. To set a true
time and frequency axis, set the sample rate (\fB\-R\fR or \fB\-\-sample\-rate\fR) to the
sample rate used when capturing the samples. Finally, the size of the FFT to
use for the PSD and spectrogram plots can be set independently with \fB\-\-psd\-size\fR
and \fB\-\-spec\-size\fR, respectively. The spectrogram plot does not display by
default and is turned on with \fB\-S\fR or \fB\-\-enable\-spec\fR.
