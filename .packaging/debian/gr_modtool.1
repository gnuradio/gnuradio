.SH NAME
gr-modtool \- The swiss army knife of module editing
.SH DESCRIPTION
When developing a module, there's a lot of boring, monotonous work
involved: boilerplate code, makefile editing etc. gr-modtool is a
script which aims to help with all these things by automatically
editing makefiles, using templates and doing as much work as possible
for the developer, such that you can jump straight into the DSP
coding.
.P
Note that gr-modtool makes a lot of assumptions on what the code looks
like. The more your module is custom and has specific changes, the
less useful gr-modtool becomes.
