This recipe is primarily used for CI builds, although it is possible to use it
locally from a checked-out git repository with "conda-build".

Developers
**********

CI builds use this recipe and the settings in ../../.conda-forge.yml. Any changes
to the recipe should be accompanied by running

    conda-smithy rerender --feedstock_config .conda-forge.yml -c auto
    git rm -f .github/workflows/automerge.yml .github/workflows/webservices.yml .circleci/config.yml
    git commit --amend -s

so that the generated build scripts are updated when necessary.

Consult the .conda-forge.yml file for additional documentation.
