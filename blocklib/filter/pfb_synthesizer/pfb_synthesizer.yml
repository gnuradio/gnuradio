    brief: |- 
        Polyphase synthesis filterbank with
        gr_complex input, gr_complex output and float taps
 
    detail: |- 
        The PFB synthesis filterbank combines multiple baseband signals
        into a single channelized signal. Each input stream is,
        essentially, modulated onto an output channel according the the
        channel mapping (see set_channel_map for details).
        
        Setting this filterbank up means selecting the number of output
        channels, the prototype filter, and whether to handle channels
        at 2x the sample rate (this is generally used only for
        reconstruction filtering).
        
        The number of channels sets the maximum number of channels to
        use, but not all input streams must be connected. For M total
        channels, we can connect inputs 0 to N where N < M-1. Because
        of the way GNU Radio handles stream connections, we must
        connect the channels consecutively, and so we must use the
        set_channel_map if the desired output channels are not the same
        as the the default mapping. This features gives us the
        flexibility to output to any given channel. Generally, we try
        to not use the channels at the edge of the spectrum to avoid
        issues with filtering and roll-off of the transmitter or
        receiver.
        
        When using the 2x sample rate mode, we specify the number of
        channels that will be used. However, the actual output signal
        will be twice this number of channels. This is mainly important
        to know when setting the channel map. For M channels, the
        channel mapping can specy from 0 to 2M-1 channels to output
        onto.
