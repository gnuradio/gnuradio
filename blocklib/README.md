# Blocklib

This folder holds the in-tree blocks, which depend on the runtime library.  Each module of blocks is within its own folder.

## How to add/port a block 

The `create_block.py` script is a stripped down modtool surrogate that drops a block directory into the desired location

### Create the block directory
```
cd blocklib/[MODULE]
python3 utils/modtool/create_block.py --intree [BLOCKNAME] --author "[AUTHOR NAME]"
```
If this block is going to be templated (such as the add or vector_source blocks), then add the `--templated` flag

This creates a directory with the following files:
```
.
├── .gitignore
├── [BLOCKNAME]_cpu.cc
├── [BLOCKNAME]_cpu.h
└── [BLOCKNAME].yml
```

### Editing the YML file
The .yml file is the landing point for all the interfaces to the block

Edit it according to the desired parameters, ports, callbacks, etc.

More detail to come about the yml spec

### Add Private Variables
Open `[BLOCKNAME]_cpu.h` which maps roughly to the `_impl.h` file from GR3

Add any private variables that will used in the block here.  Note that these do not 
have the same level of integration through all the access mechanisms as parameters, 
which can be referenced in the work function.


### The constructor and make

The make function is no longer needed as this is automatically generated

The constructor code looks like GR3 except

1) No io_signature - this is handled in the auto-generated code from the yml
2) No msg ports - also handled from the auto-generated code

The constructor has the form:
```c++
[BLOCKNAME]_cpu::[BLOCKNAME]_cpu(block_args args) : INHERITED_CONSTRUCTORS {}
```

The INHERITED_CONSTRUCTORS macro covers the initialization of the base classes since the block class is virtual, this would require initializing the same thing multiple times.  In the case of a templated block class, INHERITED_CONSTRUCTORS takes the template parameter, e.g. INHERITED_CONSTRUCTORS(T).

Each of the parameters that are defined in the `.yml` are available as a member of the `args` struct.  So what previously would have been a parameter to the constructor is now lumped into this struct so the constructor signature does not change.

### Work Function
Work functions are conceptually the same as GR3, but syntactically slightly different to keep the block API separated from the scheduler API.

```c++
    work_return_code_t work(work_io& wio) override;
```

First, the work function takes in a vector of pointers to input objects, and a vector of pointers to output objects.

To get the `noutput_items` would be
```c++
auto noutput_items = wio.outputs()[0].n_items;
```

`block_work_input` contains a pointer to the underlying buffer object - it is not just raw pointers.  But it is easy to get the underlying pointer

```c++
    auto in = wio.inputs()[0].items<T>();
    auto out = wio.outputs()[0].items<T>();
```
Where `T` is whatever specific type for a non-templated block

The return value of the work function is a return code instead of the number of output items produce.  Therefore, `produce` and `consume` must be called from within the work function.  This keeps some consistency between sync and general blocks.

```C++
wio.produce_each(noutput_items);
```
or
```C++
wio.outputs()[0].n_produced = noutput_items;
```
and then 
```
return work_return_code_t::WORK_OK;
```

### Message Handlers
When a message port is added in the yml, an automatically named handler is instatiated at the top level block class (autogenerated)

For example, for an input message port with `id: in`
```yaml
ports:
-   domain: message
    id: in
    direction: input
    optional: true
```
a virtual method is expected to be implemented in the underlying block class named 
```c++
void handle_msg_in(pmtf::pmt msg) override
```

### Callbacks

Publicly accessible methods (not necessary for parameter handlers, e.g. k() and set_k()) - but generic methods must be defined in the yaml, and then implemented in the `_cpu.cc`

More definition is needed into how these fields map, but the basic idea is this
```yaml
callbacks:
-   id: last_endpoint
    return: std::string
    const: true
```
gets autogenerated into the `blockname.h` as
```c++
virtual std::string last_endpoint() const = 0;
```
then must be implemented

There is some big `TODO`s here to make this more robust and prevent creating a new mini-language to generate some basic c++
