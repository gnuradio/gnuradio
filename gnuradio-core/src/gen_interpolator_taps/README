This file contains the source for gen_interpolator_taps, a program
which generates optimal interpolator taps for a fractional
interpolator.  

The ideal interpolator requires an infinite tap FIR filter to
realize.  We design a separate 8 tap filter for each value of mu,
the fractional delay, that we are interested in.  The taps are
selected such that the mean squared error between the ideal frequency
response and the approximation is mininimized over all frequencies of
interest.  In this implementation we define ``frequencies of
interest'' as those from -B to +B, where B = 1/(4*Ts), where Ts is the
sampling period.

For a detailed look at what this is all about, please see Chapter 9 of
"Digital Communication Receivers: Synchronization, Channel Estimation
and Signal Processing" by Meyr, Moeneclaey and Fechtel, ISBN 0-471-50275-8

NOTE, if you're running gen_interpolator_taps and it seg faults in
RANDOM, you're probably using g77-2.96.  The fix is to use g77 3.0 or later

	cd <top_of_build_tree>
	rm config.cache
	export F77=g77-3.0.4
	./configure
	make
