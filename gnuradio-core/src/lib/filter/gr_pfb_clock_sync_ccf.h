 *
 * \brief Timing synchronizer using polyphase filterbanks
 *
 * \ingroup filter_blk
 * 
 * This block performs timing synchronization for PAM signals by minimizing the
 * derivative of the filtered signal, which in turn maximizes the SNR and 
 * minimizes ISI.
 *
 * This approach works by setting up two filterbanks; one filterbank contains the 
 * signal's pulse shaping matched filter (such as a root raised cosine filter),
 * where each branch of the filterbank contains a different phase of the filter.
 * The second filterbank contains the derivatives of the filters in the first 
 * filterbank. Thinking of this in the time domain, the first filterbank contains
 * filters that have a sinc shape to them. We want to align the output signal to
 * be sampled at exactly the peak of the sinc shape. The derivative of the sinc
 * contains a zero at the maximum point of the sinc (sinc(0) = 1, sinc(0)' = 0).
 * Furthermore, the region around the zero point is relatively linear. We make
 * use of this fact to generate the error signal.
 *
 * If the signal out of the derivative filters is d_i[n] for the ith filter, and
 * the output of the matched filter is x_i[n], we calculate the error as:
 *    e[n] = (Re{x_i[n]} * Re{d_i[n]} + Im{x_i[n]} * Im{d_i[n]}) / 2.0
 * This equation averages the error in the real and imaginary parts. There are two
 * reasons we multiply by the signal itself. First, if the symbol could be positive
 * or negative going, but we want the error term to always tell us to go in the 
 * same direction depending on which side of the zero point we are on. The sign of
 * x_i[n] adjusts the error term to do this. Second, the magnitude of x_i[n] scales
 * the error term depending on the symbol's amplitude, so larger signals give us
 * a stronger error term because we have more confidence in that symbol's value.
 * Using the magnitude of x_i[n] instead of just the sign is especially good for
 * signals with low SNR.
 *
 * The error signal, e[n], gives us a value proportional to how far away from the zero
 * point we are in the derivative signal. We want to drive this value to zero, so we
 * set up a second order loop. We have two variables for this loop; d_k is the filter
 * number in the filterbank we are on and d_rate is the rate which we travel through
 * the filters in the steady state. That is, due to the natural clock differences between
 * the transmitter and receiver, d_rate represents that difference and would traverse
 * the filter phase paths to keep the receiver locked. Thinking of this as a second-order
 * PLL, the d_rate is the frequency and d_k is the phase. So we update d_rate and d_k
 * using the standard loop equations based on two error signals, d_alpha and d_beta.
 * We have these two values set based on each other for a critically damped system, so in
 * the block constructor, we just ask for "gain," which is d_alpha while d_beta is
 * equal to (gain^2)/4.
 *
 * The clock sync block needs to know the number of samples per symbol (sps), because it
 * only returns a single point representing the symbol. The sps can be any positive real
 * number and does not need to be an integer. The filter taps must also be specified. The
 * taps are generated by first conceiving of the prototype filter that would be the signal's
 * matched filter. Then interpolate this by the number of filters in the filterbank. These
 * are then distributed among all of the filters. So if the prototype filter was to have
 * 45 taps in it, then each path of the filterbank will also have 45 taps. This is easily
 * done by building the filter with the sample rate multiplied by the number of filters
 * to use.
 *
 * The number of filters can also be set and defaults to 32. With 32 filters, you get a
 * good enough resolution in the phase to produce very small, almost unnoticeable, ISI.
 * Going to 64 filters can reduce this more, but after that there is very little gained
 * for the extra complexity.
 *
 * The initial phase is another settable parameter and refers to the filter path the
 * algorithm initially looks at (i.e., d_k starts at init_phase). This value defaults 
 * to zero, but it might be useful to start at a different phase offset, such as the mid-
 * point of the filters.
 *
 * The final parameter is the max_rate_devitation, which defaults to 1.5. This is how far
 * we allow d_rate to swing, positive or negative, from 0. Constraining the rate can help
 * keep the algorithm from walking too far away to lock during times when there is no signal.
