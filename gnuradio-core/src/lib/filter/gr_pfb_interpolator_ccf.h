 * \brief Polyphase filterbank interpolator with gr_complex input,
 * gr_complex output and float taps
 *
 * This block takes in a signal stream and performs interger up-
 * sampling (interpolation) with a polyphase filterbank. The first
 * input is the integer specifying how much to interpolate by. The
 * second input is a vector (Python list) of floating-point taps of
 * the prototype filter.
 *
 * The filter's taps should be based on the interpolation rate
 * specified. That is, the bandwidth specified is relative to the
 * bandwidth after interpolation.
 *
 * For example, using the GNU Radio's firdes utility to building
 * filters, we build a low-pass filter with a sampling rate of
 * <EM>fs</EM>, a 3-dB bandwidth of <EM>BW</EM> and a transition
 * bandwidth of <EM>TB</EM>. We can also specify the out-of-band
 * attenuation to use, ATT, and the filter window function (a
 * Blackman-harris window in this case). The first input is the gain,
 * which is also specified as the interpolation rate so that the
 * output levels are the same as the input (this creates an overall
 * increase in power).
 *
 *      <B><EM>self._taps = gr.firdes.low_pass_2(interp, interp*fs, BW, TB,
 *           attenuation_dB=ATT, window=gr.firdes.WIN_BLACKMAN_hARRIS)</EM></B>
 *
 * The PFB interpolator code takes the taps generated above and builds
 * a set of filters. The set contains <EM>interp</EM> number of
 * filters and each filter contains ceil(taps.size()/interp) number of
 * taps. Each tap from the filter prototype is sequentially inserted
 * into the next filter. When all of the input taps are used, the
 * remaining filters in the filterbank are filled out with 0's to make
 * sure each filter has the same number of taps.
 *
 * The theory behind this block can be found in Chapter 7.1 of the
 * following book.
