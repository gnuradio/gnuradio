 * \brief  IIR filter with float input, float output and double taps
 *
 * This filter uses the Direct Form I implementation, where
 * \p fftaps contains the feed-forward taps, and \p fbtaps the feedback ones.
 *
 *
 * The input and output satisfy a difference equation of the form

 * Note that some texts define the system function with a + in the denominator.
 * If you're using that convention, you'll need to negate the feedback taps.
