/*!
 * \brief a computationally efficient controllable DC blocker
 *
 * This block implements a computationally efficient DC blocker that produces
 * a tighter notch filter around DC for a smaller group delay than an
 * equivalent FIR filter or using a single pole IIR filter (though the IIR
 * filter is computationally cheaper).
 *
 * The block defaults to using a delay line of length 32 and the long form
 * of the filter. Optionally, the delay line length can be changed to alter
 * the width of the DC notch (longer lines will decrease the width).
 *
 * The long form of the filter produces a nearly flat response outside of
 * the notch but at the cost of a group delay of 2D-2.
 *
 * The short form of the filter does not have as flat a response in the
 * passband but has a group delay of only D-1 and is cheaper to compute.
 *
 * The theory behind this block can be found in the paper:
 *
 *    <B><EM>R. Yates, "DC Blocker Algorithms," IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,
 *        Mar. 2008, pp 132-134.</EM></B>
