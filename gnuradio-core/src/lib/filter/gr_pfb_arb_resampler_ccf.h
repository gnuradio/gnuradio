 * \brief Polyphase filterbank arbitrary resampler with
 *        gr_complex input, gr_complex output and float taps
 *

 * This block takes in a signal stream and performs arbitrary
 * resampling. The resampling rate can be any real
 * number <EM>r</EM>. The resampling is done by constructing
 * <EM>N</EM> filters where <EM>N</EM> is the interpolation rate.  We
 * then calculate <EM>D</EM> where <EM>D = floor(N/r)</EM>.
 *
 * Using <EM>N</EM> and <EM>D</EM>, we can perform rational resampling
 * where <EM>N/D</EM> is a rational number close to the input rate
 * <EM>r</EM> where we have <EM>N</EM> filters and we cycle through
 * them as a polyphase filterbank with a stride of <EM>D</EM> so that
 * <EM>i+1 = (i + D) % N</EM>.
 *
 * To get the arbitrary rate, we want to interpolate between two
 * points. For each value out, we take an output from the current
 * filter, <EM>i</EM>, and the next filter <EM>i+1</EM> and then
 * linearly interpolate between the two based on the real resampling
 * rate we want.
 *
 * The linear interpolation only provides us with an approximation to
 * the real sampling rate specified. The error is a quantization error
 * between the two filters we used as our interpolation points.  To
 * this end, the number of filters, <EM>N</EM>, used determines the
 * quantization error; the larger <EM>N</EM>, the smaller the
 * noise. You can design for a specified noise floor by setting the
 * filter size (parameters <EM>filter_size</EM>). The size defaults to
 * 32 filters, which is about as good as most implementations need.
 *
 * The trick with designing this filter is in how to specify the taps
 * of the prototype filter. Like the PFB interpolator, the taps are
 * specified using the interpolated filter rate. In this case, that
 * rate is the input sample rate multiplied by the number of filters
 * in the filterbank, which is also the interpolation rate. All other
 * values should be relative to this rate.
 *
 * For example, for a 32-filter arbitrary resampler and using the
 * GNU Radio's firdes utility to build the filter, we build a low-pass
 * filter with a sampling rate of <EM>fs</EM>, a 3-dB bandwidth of
 * <EM>BW</EM> and a transition bandwidth of <EM>TB</EM>. We can also
 * specify the out-of-band attenuation to use, <EM>ATT</EM>, and the
 * filter window function (a Blackman-harris window in this case). The
 * first input is the gain of the filter, which we specify here as the
 * interpolation rate (<EM>32</EM>).
 *
 *      <B><EM>self._taps = gr.firdes.low_pass_2(32, 32*fs, BW, TB,
 *           attenuation_dB=ATT, window=gr.firdes.WIN_BLACKMAN_hARRIS)</EM></B>
 *
 * The theory behind this block can be found in Chapter 7.5 of
 * the following book.
