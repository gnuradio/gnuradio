 * This class efficiently combines a frequency translation
 * (typically "down conversion") with a FIR filter (typically low-pass)
 * and decimation.  It is ideally suited for a "channel selection filter"
 * and can be efficiently used to select and decimate a narrow band signal
 * out of wide bandwidth input.
 *
 * Uses a single input array to produce a single output array.
 * Additional inputs and/or outputs are ignored.
