 * \brief Given a stream of bits and access_code flags, assemble packets.
 *
 * input: stream of bytes from gr_correlate_access_code_bb
 * output: none.  Pushes assembled packet into target queue
 *
 * The framer expects a fixed length header of 2 16-bit shorts
 * containing the payload length, followed by the payload.  If the
 * 2 16-bit shorts are not identical, this packet is ignored.  Better
 * algs are welcome.
 *
 * The input data consists of bytes that have two bits used.
 * Bit 0, the LSB, contains the data bit.
 * Bit 1 if set, indicates that the corresponding bit is the
 * the first bit of the packet.  That is, this bit is the first
 * one after the access code.
