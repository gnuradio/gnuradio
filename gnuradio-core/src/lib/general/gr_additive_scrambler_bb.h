 * Scramble an input stream using an LFSR.  This block works on the LSB only
 * of the input data stream, i.e., on an "unpacked binary" stream, and
 * produces the same format on its output.
 *
 * \param mask     Polynomial mask for LFSR
 * \param seed     Initial shift register contents
 * \param len      Shift register length
 * \param count    Number of bits after which shift register is reset, 0=never
 *
 * The scrambler works by XORing the incoming bit stream by the output of
 * the LFSR.  Optionally, after 'count' bits have been processed, the shift
 * register is reset to the seed value.  This allows processing fixed length
 * vectors of samples.
