/*! \brief A rate 1/2, k=7 convolutional decoder for the CCSDS standard
 *
 * This block performs soft-decision convolutional decoding using the Viterbi
 * algorithm.
 *
 * The input is a stream of (possibly noise corrupted) floating point values
 * nominally spanning [-1.0, 1.0], representing the encoded channel symbols
 * 0 (-1.0) and 1 (1.0), with erased symbols at 0.0.
 *
 * The output is MSB first packed bytes of decoded values.
 *
 * As a rate 1/2 code, there will be one output byte for every 16 input symbols.
 *
 * This block is designed for continuous data streaming, not packetized data.
 * The first 32 bits out will be zeroes, with the output delayed four bytes
 * from the corresponding inputs.
