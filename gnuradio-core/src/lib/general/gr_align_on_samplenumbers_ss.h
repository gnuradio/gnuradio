/*!
 * \brief align several complex short (interleaved short) input channels with corresponding unsigned 32 bit sample_counters (provided as interleaved 16 bit values)
 * \param number of complex_short input channels (including the 32 bit counting channel)
 * \param align_interval is after how much samples (minimally) the sample-alignement is refreshed. Default is 128.
 * A bigger value means less processing power but also requests more buffer space, which has a maximum.
 * Decrease the align_interval if you get an error like:
 * "sched: <gr_block align_on_samplenumbers_ss (0)> is requesting more input data  than we can provide.
 *  ninput_items_required = 32768
 *  max_possible_items_available = 16383
 *  If this is a filter, consider reducing the number of taps."
 * Pay attention on how you connect this block.
 * It expects a minimum of 2 usrp_source_s with nchan number of channels and FPGA_MODE_COUNTING_32BIT enabled.
 * This means that the first complex_short channel on every input is an interleaved 32 bit counter.
 * The samples are aligned by dropping samples untill the samplenumbers match.
