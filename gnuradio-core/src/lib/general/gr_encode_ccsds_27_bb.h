/*! \brief A rate 1/2, k=7 convolutional encoder for the CCSDS standard
 *
 * This block performs convolutional encoding using the CCSDS standard
 * polynomial ("Voyager").
 *
 * The input is an MSB first packed stream of bits.
 *
 * The output is a stream of symbols 0 or 1 representing the encoded data.
 *
 * As a rate 1/2 code, there will be 16 output symbols for every input byte.
 *
 * This block is designed for continuous data streaming, not packetized data.
 * There is no provision to "flush" the encoder.
