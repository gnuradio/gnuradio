         Handles connecting signals from given actions to handlers
            self    - Calling class
            actions - Dictionary of a QAction and unique key

         Dynamically build the connections for the signals by finding the correct
         function to handle an action. Default behavior is to connect checkable actions to
         the 'toggled' signal and normal actions to the 'triggered' signal. If 'toggled' is
         not avaliable or useToggled is set to False then try to connect it to triggered.
         Both toggled and triggered are called for checkable items, so there is no need for
         both to be connected.

            void QAction::toggled ( bool checked ) [signal]
            void QAction::triggered ( bool checked = false ) [signal]
              - Checked is set for checkable actions

         Essentially the same as QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName, except the actions
          and slots can be separated into a view and controller class
