This directory contains icons, a mime type, and menu files for grc.
Installation of these files requires a set of tools called xdg-utils.
xdg-utils will install files in a standard way according to the freedesktop.org standards.

Desktop enviroments that implement these standards are gnome, kde, xfce, and others.
If you have one of these desktop enviroments, xdg-utils should come installed.
If xdg-utils is not installed, then this directory will be ignored by the build.

The gtk IconTheme module locates the installed icons for use inside the grc app.
On recent versions of gtk, IconTheme ignores the icons installed into the default theme.
This presents a problem for the gnome file system browser, nautilus, and the grc app.
As a solution, icons are also installed under the gnome theme.

*.png files - these are the icons of various sizes
*.desktop files - these are the menu items for grc executables
*.xml file - this is the mime type for the saved flow graphs
