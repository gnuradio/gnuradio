Welcome to GNU Radio!


Please see http://gnuradio.org for the wiki, bug tracking,
and source code viewer.

If you've got questions about GNU Radio, please subscribe to the
discuss-gnuradio mailing list and post your questions there.

There is also a "Build Guide" in the wiki that contains OS specific
recommendations:

The bleeding edge code can be found in our git repository at
http://gnuradio.org/git/gnuradio.git/. To checkout the latest, use
this command:

  $ git clone git://gnuradio.org/gnuradio

How to Build GNU Radio:

For more complete instructions, see the "Building GNU Radio" page in
the GNU Radio manual (can be built or found online at
http://gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/page_build.html).

See these steps fow a quick build guide.

  (1) Ensure that you've satisfied the external dependencies. These
      dependencies are listed in the manual's build page and are not
      presented here to reduce duplication errors.
  
      On systems using pkgsrc (e.g. NetBSD and Dragonfly), build
      meta-packages/gnuradio, which will build a previous release and
      force installation of the dependencies.  Then pkg_delete the
      gnuradio package, which will leave the dependencies.  (This
      should also work on OSX.)

      See the wiki at http://gnuradio.org for details.


  (2) Building from cmake:

      $ mkdir $(builddir)
      $ cd $(builddir)
      $ cmake [OPTIONS] $(srcdir)
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ sudo make install


That's it!

Options:
Useful options include setting the install prefix and the build type:

  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<directory to install to>
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="<type>"

Currently, GNU Radio has a "Debug" type that builds with '-g -O2'
useful for debugging the software and a "Release" type that builds
with '-O3', which is the default.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		       KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES


  GNU Radio triggers bugs in g++ 3.3 for X86.  DO NOT USE GCC 3.3 on
  the X86 platform.  g++ 3.2, 3.4, and the 4.* series are known to work well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			  NOTES

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the examples you may need to set PYTHONPATH.  Note that the
prefix and python version number in the path needs to match your
installed version of python.

  $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

You may want to add this to your shell init file (~/.bash_profile if
you use bash).


Another handy trick if for example your fftw includes and libs are
installed in, say ~/local/include and ~/local/lib, instead of
/usr/local is this:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib
    $ make CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include"


Sometimes the prerequisites are installed in a location which is not
included in the default compiler and linker search paths.  This
happens with pkgsrc and NetBSD.  To build, tell configure to use these
locations:

	LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnuradio


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			  Legal Matters

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some files have been changed many times throughout the
years. Copyright notices at the tops of these files list which years
changes have been made. For some files, changes have occurred in many
consecutive years. These files may often have the format of a year
range (e.g., "2006 - 2011"), which indicates that these files have had
copyrightable changes made during each year in the range, inclusive.
