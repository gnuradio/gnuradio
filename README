This is a Spire fork of the GNU Radio project made mostly to enforce internal
versioning and build procedures.  Little, if any, internal code has been
modified.

Please see http://gnuradio.org for the wiki, bug tracking,
and source code viewer.

If you've got questions about GNU Radio, please subscribe to the
discuss-gnuradio mailing list and post your questions there.

There is also a "Build Guide" in the wiki that contains OS specific
recommendations:

## How to install

Spire has modified the build process for GNU Radio to generate a
custom debian package.  This should be present in the Spire apt
repository, if not or if you've made modifications, you may need to
build from source.

## How to Build GNU Radio from source:

```
./build.sh
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
sudo gdebi gnuradi-XXX.deb
```
The original directions for compilation can be found in the README.md at 
https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio.


## KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES


  GNU Radio triggers bugs in g++ 3.3 for X86.  DO NOT USE GCC 3.3 on
  the X86 platform.  g++ 3.2, 3.4, and the 4.* series are known to work well.

## NOTES

To run the examples you may need to set PYTHONPATH.  Note that the
prefix and python version number in the path needs to match your
installed version of python.

```
$ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
```

You may want to add this to your shell init file (~/.bash_profile if
you use bash).


Another handy trick if for example your fftw includes and libs are
installed in, say ~/local/include and ~/local/lib, instead of
/usr/local is this:

```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib
$ make CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include"
```

Sometimes the prerequisites are installed in a location which is not
included in the default compiler and linker search paths.  This
happens with pkgsrc and NetBSD.  To build, tell configure to use these
locations:

```
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnuradio
```

##Legal Matters

Some files have been changed many times throughout the
years. Copyright notices at the tops of these files list which years
changes have been made. For some files, changes have occurred in many
consecutive years. These files may often have the format of a year
range (e.g., "2006 - 2011"), which indicates that these files have had
copyrightable changes made during each year in the range, inclusive.
