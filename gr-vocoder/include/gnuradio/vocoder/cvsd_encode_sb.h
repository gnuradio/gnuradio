     * \brief This block performs CVSD audio encoding.  Its design and
     * implementation is modeled after the CVSD encoder/decoder
     * specifications defined in the Bluetooth standard.

     *
     * \details
     * CVSD is a method for encoding speech that seeks to reduce the
     * bandwidth required for digital voice transmission. CVSD takes
     * advantage of strong correlation between samples, quantizing the
     * difference in amplitude between two consecutive samples. This
     * difference requires fewer quantization levels as compared to
     * other methods that quantize the actual amplitude level,
     * reducing the bandwidth. CVSD employs a two level quantizer
     * (one bit) and an adaptive algorithm that allows for continuous
     * step size adjustment.
     *
     * The coder can represent low amplitude signals with accuracy
     * without sacrificing performance on large amplitude signals, a
     * trade off that occurs in some non-adaptive modulations.
     *
     * The CVSD encoder effectively provides 8-to-1 compression. More
     * specifically, each incoming audio sample is compared to an
     * internal reference value. If the input is greater or equal to
     * the reference, the encoder outputs a "1" bit. If the input is
     * less than the reference, the encoder outputs a "0" bit.  The
     * reference value is then updated accordingly based on the
     * frequency of outputted "1" or "0" bits. By grouping 8 outputs
     * bits together, the encoder essentially produce one output byte
     * for every 8 input audio samples.
     *
     * This encoder requires that input audio samples are 2-byte short
     * signed integers. The result bandwidth conversion, therefore,
     * is 16 input bytes of raw audio data to 1 output byte of encoded
     * audio data.
     *
     * The CVSD encoder module must be prefixed by an up-converter to
     * over-sample the audio data prior to encoding. The Bluetooth
     * standard specifically calls for a 1-to-8 interpolating
     * up-converter.  While this reduces the overall compression of
     * the codec, this is required so that the encoder can accurately
     * compute the slope between adjacent audio samples and correctly
     * update its internal reference value.
