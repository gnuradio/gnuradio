    This is a wrapper for the CVSD encoder that performs interpolation and filtering

    it (to 32000; slightly below the maximum value), interpolates it, and then vocodes it.

    The incoming sampling rate can be anything, though, of course, the higher the sampling rate and the
    higher the interpolation rate are, the better the sound quality.
